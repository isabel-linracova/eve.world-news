POSTOUVIN - The Society of Conscious Thought has confirmed the official commissioning of the Kyonoke Inquest Center, which lies in close proximity to the quarantined RP4 Hemorphite processing facility in Postouvin.

Speaking to a selection of interstellar press whom were invited aboard the structure for the occasion, SoCT Elder Mentor Raish confirmed that the facility is now fully operational, and has been formally designated as the "H4-RP4 Kyonoke Inquest Center".

Adding to the announcement, he stated that the installation "represents the pinnacle of genetic research and development, with the most advanced genetic engineering and bio labs in the cluster".

Elder Raish then elaborated on plans for the future of the Center, including the impending arrival of science teams from the Empire, State, Federation and Republic, commenting that "in the coming weeks, independent capsuleers from across the cluster will join teams selected by sovereign governments, in an effort to work toward a common resolution for the Kyonoke crisis."

Closing the press conference before thanking the media, Raish also confirmed the dates for the YC119 Kyonoke Inquest from April 6th - 8th, two weeks from now.

The Scope observed hundreds of vessels arriving at the Inquest Center this morning, which were rumoured to be delivering laboratory equipment, supplies and HAZMAT containment equipment.
