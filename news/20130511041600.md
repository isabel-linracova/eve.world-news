_New Caldari –_ The [Caldari Navy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Navy) and [Chief Executive Panel](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Chief Executive Panel) have announced they are conducting a joint investigation of the events surrounding the [Gallente](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente) assault on [Caldari Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Prime) and the crash of the Leviathan-class [titan](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Titans) Shiigeru on the planet. The investigation, which has been conducted until now under top security protocols, is nearing completion.

Neither the Navy nor the CEP have announced what specific details they are investigating, instead saying, “We are conducting a broad analysis of the entire situation, from the highest levels of command to the very bottom.”

The CEP has extended its investigation to capsuleers involved in the assault and is asking any who participated and wish to provide testimony to contact Odo Hakaalen, the CEP's capsuleer liaison. The CEP expects to complete the report within the next two weeks.

The Gallente [Senate](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Senate) has requested that the CEP and Navy share the results of their findings, which the CEP has reportedly agreed to.
