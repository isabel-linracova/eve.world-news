According to reports, associates of the [Angel Cartel](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Angel Cartel), [Blood Raiders](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Blood Raiders), [Guristas](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Guristas), [Intaki Syndicate](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Intaki Syndicate), and [Serpentis](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Serpentis) have been putting out feelers amongst capsuleers about recovering equipment salvage from the so-called “ghost sites” that have been appearing recently. These ghost sites, which have been declared off-limits by [CONCORD](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/CONCORD), appear to be related to some form of cutting-edge research being conducted by various outlaw groups. In addition to retrieving numerous pieces of salvage and blueprints for the manufacture of ‘Ascendency’ implants, many have also taken “covert research tools” from the sites. It is apparently these tools which are being sought out by the pirate groups. Rumors indicate that the pirates will soon be creating buy orders through go-betweens in order to recover them.
