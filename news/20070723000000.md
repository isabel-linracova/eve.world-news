Woratome Kikawa, Chief Executor of the newly-founded Independent Gaming Commission last week announced that the Commission will officially take over handling of capsuleer alliance tournaments.

'I'm happy to announce that the Tournament will continue, but it is not longer strictly tied to one empire. To collect the funding needed for the tournament we now instead have investors from all four. From the Caldari State, we welcome members of the Mercantile Club; from the Minmatar Republic we enjoy the expertise of the Leisure Group; the Gallentean Bank of Luminaire will provide us with financial backing; and the Amarr Certified News will cover all news from the Tournament this year. '

Mr Kikawa began his career with the Caldari Gaming Commission last year as a top executive, quickly landing the hosting contracts they needed to continue the tournament. His skill at negotiation and general business savvy had him quickly ascending the corporate ladder. When the CGC was found guilty of tax evasion and announced their decision not to host the Tournament, Kikawa began lobbying to find a team of people that would host the Tournament independently of one single empire.
