VILLORE – The Gallente Senate announced the results of yesterday’s internal election for a new Head Senator this morning, after the 24 hour voting period came to a close. Renvieve Jolousse, interim head Senator for the last 10 days and head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, formally confirmed the results via press release a little over an hour ago.

Stepping up from her position as leader of the Senate’s Domestic Security Council, Senator Andon Gardieu will assume the role of Head Senator, formally known as ‘Speaker of the Chamber’, this evening when she is sworn in during a special ceremony by Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Broyal Alserette.

The announcement has so far been met with extremely positive public sentiment, with this being the first time in almost a century that a female Head Senator has been elected. Speaking to the press from her family residence on Villore IV, the 67 year old former servicewoman, who spent 26 years with the Federation Navy, expressed her delight at the result and offered her most “sincere gratitude for the support shown by the people of the Federation”.

Her inauguration ceremony this evening is expected to be attended by President Jacus Roden, Black Eagles Director Mentas Blaque, and Senator Gardieu’s former commanding officer with the Federation Navy, Admiral Auvier Bauvon.

It was also announced in the same press release that Gilles Ranchel, nephew of the Federation Navy’s Grand Admiral will assume Senator Gardieu’s position as leader of the Senate’s Domestic Security Council.
