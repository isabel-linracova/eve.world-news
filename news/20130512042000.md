_Villore –_ The man who opened fire at a [Minmatar](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Minmatar) cultural festival, killing 59 and wounding 303 others, has been identified as Gerne Broteau and was brought before the Caille District Court today, where he was charged with 59 counts of first degree murder, 362 counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and 12 counts of mayhem with the intent to incite terror, along with numerous other charges.

Broteau has been identified as a man of [Gallente](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ethnic Gallente) ethnicity in good health. He does not have a criminal record prior to his rampage that claimed the life of [Sebiestor](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sebiestor Tribe) Tribal Chief [Karin Midular](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Karin Midular). He is being characterized as a loner who worked without accomplice, apparently motivated by a nationalistic, anti-foreigner stance.

He remained under police guard for over a month as a full investigation was launched into his motives and the possibility he was part of a criminal terror cell. However, after repeated attempts at interrogation, no evidence was uncovered that Broteau was working with any other group.

Appearing in restraints in a prison jumpsuit, Broteau stood silent and impassive as the numerous charges against him were read without fanfare. The presiding judge had to request silence twice before the gallery quieted enough to finish reading the charges.

GalNet searches have revealed the Broteau frequented numerous anti-foreigner forums and frequently posted about his hatred of Minmatar immigrants, desire to remove all non-[Gallente](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente) elements from the Federation, and admiration for the [Black Eagles](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Black Eagles) and Director [Mentas Blaque](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mentas Blaque). Before becoming the director of the Black Eagles, Mentas Blaque was known as an outspoken leader of the Sociocrats party, which has long espoused isolation and strict immigration controls for the Federation.

The Black Eagles have issued a statement in response to the findings, denouncing Broteau and saying, “The man does not, never has, and never will have any involvement with the Special Department of Internal Investigations and Federal Security.”

Broteau's trial is scheduled to begin on Monday.
