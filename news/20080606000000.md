Illuin - The political crisis in the Minmatar Republic worsened as Prime Minister Karin Midular defiantly responded to Shakor's successful vote of no-confidence by dissolving parliament. The measure requires a call for new elections within two months, as mandated by Republic law. In addition, there are reports that Ambassador Keitan Yun has been relieved of his post and that Parliament Head Maleatu Shakor has been "expelled" from government. However, Karin Midular lacks the legal authority to dismiss an elected official unless evidence of a crime has been presented, which she has not yet claimed-at least not publically.

Mr. Yun has not been seen since the Yulai "incident", in which his apparent threat to CONCORD was supported by the sudden appearance of a menacing Minmatar-Thukker fleet in Yulai. Maleatu Shakor was last seen being escorted from session following the no-confidence vote against Midular.

Violence erupted on the parliament floor immediately after her announcement, forcing station security to quickly surround and then escort the prime minister from session.
