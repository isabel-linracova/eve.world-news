Tensions are rising as only one day remains until the start of the alliance fighting tournament. Voices have been sounding from all over, trying to guess the outcome of the event, and some teams have been revealed as definite favorites by the public. Ever since their original announcement, the Caldari Gaming Commission has remained quiet regarding the event, only stating that they will release the tournament pairings at 18:00 today.  
  
Two large capsuleer corporations have decided to use the opportunity and host public betting services. Both [Eve University](http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=268921) and BIG Corporation are allowing pilots to take part in the championships by waging money on the team they think will win. Interest is clearly high, as waged amounts are already in the hundreds of millions and rising.  
  
Whether for contestants or spectators, excitement is at a maximum.
