Pator - The Republic Government today released the latest report on immigration figures which continued to show a dramatic decline in emigration from the Republic, coupled with a steady rise in Minmatar returning to the Republic from the Federation.

Although experts in the field predicted a continuing drop in emigration numbers due to the positive industrial news, continuing unity from the government and the growing optimism of the general populace saw a surprising gain in immigration from the Federation.

"A closer study of the numbers," stated Professor Kell Baraim, dean of Economics at the Republic University, "shows that the vast majority of those returning are first generation immigrants, the ones who have been in the Federation shortest. It remains to be seen whether this is a sustainable trend or simply a short term reaction to the current upswing of confidence in the Republic and its environs."
