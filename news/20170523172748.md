E-DOF2, Period Basis â€“ The Blood Raider Covenant's Omir Sarikusa has issued a defiant response to the destruction of his organization's Sotiyo-class shipyard by capsuleers of the Imperium coalition on YC119.05.19.

Speaking exclusively to Ret Gloriaxx of the Scope's Galactic Hour, Sarikusa declared the loss of the shipyard "a necessary and holy sacrifice on the path of the Great Truth". Going further, the Blood Raider leader asserted that "our legions sanctified in blood will renew this work, and once more strike down the false and the faithless, even as they squabble amongst themselves". This was apparently a reflection on the internecine combat between the Imperium group and the TEST alliance surrounding the looting of the Sotiyo.

Sarikusa also claimed that "the Sow-Queen squatting atop her throne of base metal showed by her inaction the impotency of her rule, corrupted and thin as her own blood!" This latter remark was evidently a reference to Empress Catiz I of the Amarr Empire. When asked for comment, the Court Chamberlain's Office would only say: "The ravings of a mad heretic are beneath the dignity of the Throne."

For their part, capsuleers have commented adversely as to the capabilities of the Sotiyo's defenses, noting that the lack of a close-in point defense system allowed the Imperium to bring the Sotiyo down with a fleet composed of frigates.
