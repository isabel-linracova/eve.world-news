_Villore –_ The [Federation](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente) [Senate](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Senate) today overwhelmingly voted on a resolution to condemn the actions surrounding Admiral Visera Yanala's death and has urged the [Chief Executive Panel](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Chief Executive Panel) to further investigate the incident. The resolution, sponsored by Head of the Senate Aulmont Meis, passed 756-101, with 24 abstentions.

The resolution reads, in full, “On this May 26<sup>th</sup>, YC 115, the Senate of the Federated Union of Gallente Prime completely and unequivocally condemns the death of the Caldari war hero Admiral Visera Yanala by forced ingestion of poison. Admiral Yanala, acting to preserve human life, bravely disobeyed orders to open fire with a doomsday weapon against [Caldari Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Prime). In response, her superior forced her into ritual suicide. The Senate requests the Chief Executive Panel of the Caldari State fully investigate this matter and bring the perpetrator to justice.”

The CEP has yet to respond to the resolution as it continues its investigation.
