**Colelie, Sinq Laison** - In the early hours of 28.01.113, Sansha forces were defeated by a mixed fleet of at least 100 capsuleers and a Nation supercarrier was destroyed. This was despite the efforts of Nation loyalists who attempted to defend the Sansha forces by activating smartbombs against the attacking pilots.  
  
Sansha forces were first seen in the Parchanier system in the Algintal constellation. Once word of the incursion spread, arriving capsuleers joined fleets with those they met in the local systems, as Asaface, a pilot involved throughout explained: "There wasnt so much of an autocratic system with our guys, we added people who knew people... A lot of blue standings were handed out between pilots during these..."  
  
With pilots meeting for the first time as they prepared fleets against the Sansha forces, it was difficult for them to put faith into strangers, as Asaface admitted "it is very difficult to know who to trust and who not to trust." This comes on the back of reports that some capsuleers had witnessed fellow pilots turn upon each other rather than fight back against the Sansha.  
  
Kybernetes Moros of True Slave Foundations, along with several Nation loyalist capsuleers, chose to actively protect the Sansha forces and after lying in wait for the crucial moment, activated smartbombs. In doing so, loyalist Drake Arson revealed that they "recorded nearly thirty kills". Kybernetes boasted that he was solely responsible for the destruction of "roughly thirteen T1 frigates or smaller and fourteen pods."  
  
Although there were casualties in the battle, the Sansha forces were defeated and the first known Sansha Nation supercarrier was destroyed. News of the success quickly began to spread throughout New Eden.  
  
As more incursions are reported throughout New Eden, there are those that are wholly comitted to helping the Sansha forces. However there are capsuleers who are completely dedicated to stopping the Sansha Nation. Asaface is one of those capsuleers and he only has one thing in his mind as he prepares for the future, and that is "to get more fleets and bigger fleets, and more organised."
