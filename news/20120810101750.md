BIG, one of the oldest corporations in New Eden, has celebrated a milestone birthday.

The ten year old corporation, still run by co-founder Tornsoul, is currently best known for its lotteries, which have netted lucky capsuleers trillions of ISK in prizes. The BIG Lottery turned 9 earlier this year. BIG is also the owner of BMBE (BIG Merchant Bank of EVE), the oldest surviving IPO in New Eden.
