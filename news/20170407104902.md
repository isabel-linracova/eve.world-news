POSTOUVIN - Security has been tightened at the Kyonoke Inquest Center this morning, after a senior member of the Society of Conscious Thought's research team was found dead in one of two laboratories that appear to have been ransacked over the course of the night.

The discovery of the body of the unidentified science team member comes alongside the ransacking of two key virology research labs which were thought to be holding data on the original source of the Kyonoke Plague outbreak on board the RP4 Facility. Initial reports suggest that the member of the science team met with foul play.

Dr. Cador Veranne, Kyonoke Inquest Research & Development Director, urged for calm at a briefing this morning during a briefing session with the science teams on board the Keepstar class citadel serving as the base of operations for the inquest.

At this stage, little is known about the motivations of the assailants, or the extent of the damage. The Scope will continue to report on major events at the Inquest Center as they occur.
