Yulai -The mystery armada whose threatening presence nearly touched off a deadly confrontation outside CONCORD Bureau Station in Yulai has left without incident. The sudden appearance of the fleet, their unknown origins, ability to jump capital ships into the most secure space in New Eden, and refusal to communicate has left the prestigious law enforcement agency scrambling for answers. CONCORD issued a terse statement clearly intended as a warning for would-be criminals that "respond and neutralize" capabilities are operating at maximum capacity. Full coverage of the event, including raw footage recorded onsite, can be found on the [Scope News Network.](http://ccp.vo.llnwd.net/o2/video/2/empyrean_age_teaser2_1280x720.wmv) A [high quality feed](http://ccp.vo.llnwd.net/o2/video/2/empyrean_age_teaser2_1920x1080.wmv ) is also available.
