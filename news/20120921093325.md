**Amamake, Heimatar** - The Heretic Army is running a continual frigate battle known as _Frigfest_ in the Amamake Solar System. The event started on the 17th of September and so far more than three billion ISK of ships and equipment have been destroyed in that system.

There are several prizes up for grabs including a faction-fit faction frigate of the winner's choice for top solo killer, and a T2 frigate with T2 fittings for the overall top killer.
