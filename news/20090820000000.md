New Caldari - The SCOPE has learned that the Ishukone Corporation has bid for and won the rights to develop the Intaki System.

The terms of the Intaki acquisition are unknown.

The Caldari Providence Directorate released a brief statement officially acknowledging the auction and announced that they would disclose the winning bids and systems after bidding concludes this Friday.

A spokesperson for Ishukone confirmed that the Intaki System was the only acquisition for the mega-corporation in the auction.
