_The Citadel –_ Soon after news of [Caldari Navy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Navy) Executive Officer Mininela Erinen's testimony about Admiral Yanala's death was released, several memorial services for the war hero suddenly turned into impromptu protests as people called for answers from State Executor [Tibus Heth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth). Several of the protests subsequently turned violent, when demonstrators clashed with [Provist](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Providence Directorate) forces. So far, no deaths have been reported, though hundreds have been reported as injured.

Into the morning, Caldari citizens have continued to react with disbelief and anger to the news. Said one protestor who works for [Lai Dai](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Lai Dai Corporation), “Tibus Heth must give an accounting of himself. He can't sit silent in his iron tower and expect us to accept this. Admiral Yanala was a hero and he cannot simply expect us to forget about this.”

Others have reacted with slightly greater reservation. Said a middle manager from [Hyasyoda](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Hyasyoda Corporation), “We've only heard one side of the story. Obviously if true it's horrible. But anyone who is rioting is just participating in a mob mentality. There's no proof about what she's said. It's her word against the State Executor's. We must wait for the CEP to finish their investigation.”
