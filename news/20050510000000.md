It appears that the wormhole that allowed CCP to import [Quafe](http://myeve.eve-online.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=630&tid=1) is closing on the 25th of May. At this time, we do not know if this event is a natural occurance, or the result of legal action taken on the part of Starsi and/or other manufacturers in the EVE galaxy.  
  
What this means is that you have 15 days remaining to buy a [bottle](http://www.eve-online.com/store/comersus_viewItem.asp?idProduct=47) or a [12 pack](http://www.eve-online.com/store/comersus_viewItem.asp?idProduct=48) of Quafe. After the 25th, the wormhole will close and it will be gone forever.
