Hagilur - Executives of Boundless Creation today laid out the welcome mat at Hagilur as they hosted a delegation from one of the Thukker Tribe's largest recognized corporations, Thukker Mix.

Thukker Mix are perhaps best known for their cutting-edge ship designs, many based on standard Republic ship hulls, which have risen to prominence amongst the capsuleer elite.&nbsp; The Mix have also created a number of lesser known innovations that have found their way to the mass market.

Boundless Creations spokesperson Wyum Ril stated: "We have been involved in dialogue behind the scenes with Thukker Mix for some time and are now ready to take the next step into what we hope will be a prosperous relationship between our two groups.&nbsp; We'd like to give a warm welcome to our friends from Thukker Mix, and we thank the government for its continuing support&nbsp;of our efforts."

In the wake of&nbsp;the Elder War (the name given to the recent conflict by the Republic's citizenry), the stance towards the Republic's Thukker kin has started to shift substantially.&nbsp; The old government once pursued a policy of actively distancing itself from the Thukkers, who were&nbsp;widely regarded&nbsp;as scoundrels and vagabonds.&nbsp; This policy has been reversed by the new administration, with Sanmatar Shakor issuing his personal congratulations to Boundless Creation&nbsp;for what he refers to as a "move towards the future."
