YULAI â€“ CONCORD has declared a cluster-wide "Rogue Swarm Alert", as reports continue to come in from across New Eden of multiple major infestations of rogue drones.

CONCORD's Directive Enforcement Department has emphasized the danger of allowing the outbreak locations designated "Rogue Swarm Nests" to spread unchecked, and has called on all combat capable pilots to assist in exterminating the infestation.

The DED's Brigadier General Odo Korachi has provided additional tactical details: "The DED Genesis Fleet's Intelligence Wing has determined that the Rogue Swarm Nests are organized around commanding units that we are designating as 'Swarm Overminds'. It appears that these Overmind units are the driving force behind this Rogue Swarm and we consider them primary targets."

"All pilots answering the call of this Rogue Swarm Alert are urged to seek out Rogue Swarm Nests and destroy the Swarm Overminds found within. The CONCORD Assembly has authorized blanket rights to all materials recovered from these sites to participating combat pilots," concluded General Korachi.

The Scope will monitor and report on this situation as it develops.
