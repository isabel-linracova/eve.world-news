YULAI â€“ Contracts issued against Serpentis assets through the Scope Network continue to attract capsuleers willing and able to take up the fight against the infamous V. Salvador Sarpati and the rising shadow of the Serpentis military build-up.

The leading ten participants in the efforts against the Serpentis crime organization will be rewarded with special awards of Serpentis capital ship blueprint copies when the campaign concludes. The announced reserve of five single-run Vendetta BPCs and five single-run Vanquisher BPCs will be awarded to those capsuleers that have earned the most points from Scope Network contracts as they aid the empires and fight against the Serpentis threat

The listing of the top capsuleer contractors as of noon standard time YC118-07-20 follows:
