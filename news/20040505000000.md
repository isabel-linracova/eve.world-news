The Jovian Directorate today issued a press release to all major news agencies throughout the universe. The release states that Misu Baniya, Extra-Racial Liaison for the Jove Directorate, will tomorrow, over the course of only one hour, make diplomatic visits to President Foiritan of the Gallente Federation, Amarr Emperor Kor-Azor, PM Midular of the Minmatar Republic, and the headquarters of the Caldari State's Chief Executive Panel, as well as "other factional leaders, heretofore unrecognized by the diplomatic community at large."  
  
As stated in the release, the visit is intended to commemorate tomorrow's one-year anniversary of the founding of the Interstellar Services Division, the multi-corp, multi-racial conglomerate which many believe has been the biggest contributor to the vast increase in the number of pilots traversing the spacelanes this last year, and which, according to the release, "has worked wonders in stimulating economic and social growth throughout the universe."  
  
Baniya himself was instrumental in founding and setting up the ISD, helping get the giant multi-billion ISK project off the ground. He became known by associates for his deft touch at dispute mediation and calm detachment in times of crisis.   
  
Baniya's visit will also be used as an opportunity to utilize the Jovians' latest state-of-the-art technological marvel, a new form of transportation. The release's wording is cryptic when describing this piece of equipment, but judging by the sheer number of visits Baniya intends to make in only one hour - and the distances involved between them - it looks to be something quite special indeed.  
  
Halls of government everywhere have already begun preparations for the liaison's arrival. He is expected to arrive at his first stop, New Caldari, at 12:00 EVT tomorrow.
