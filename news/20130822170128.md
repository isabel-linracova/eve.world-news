_Kor-Azor Prime –_ In the first public statement made by a member of the [Privy Council](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Privy Council) since news broke about [Merimeth Sarum's](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Merimeth Sarum) proposal to relaunch the [Reclaiming](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Reclaiming), [Aritcio Kor-Azor](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Aritcio Kor-Azor) preached a calm and measured approach.

“We must not rush hastily into an escalation of war,” the [Heir](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr Heirs) and [Imperial Chancellor](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Imperial Chancellor) said to reporters with the [Amarr Certified News](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr Certified News). “The Empyrean War has already taken a heavy toll on [the Bleak Lands](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The Bleak Lands) and Devoid. We must be cautious if we do not want to bring it to the borders of the Throne Worlds themselves.”

According to Kor-Azor, the [Empire](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr) must tread carefully and only act after a full examination of the situation has been made. “Is the [Minmatar Republic](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Minmatar) really more belligerent, as some are claiming? Or is it merely the chirping of an annoyed furrier with no force behind it? We must determine the truth of the matter before we take any sort of action.” Despite this, the Heir has pledged “my house's forces stand ready for whatever my empress commands.”

[Sanmatar](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sanmatar) [Maleatu Shakor](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Maleatu Shakor) has issued a statement denouncing Merimeth Sarum and [Catiz Tash-Murkon](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Catiz Tash-Murkon), saying, “The Minmatar Republic does not take threats against it lightly. We have stood resolute for over a century and will never be subject to oppression again. Our culture, our people, our lives are our own and nobody else's. Any sign of aggression from the Empire will be met and revisited tenfold.”

Mediators from [CONCORD](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/CONCORD) have apparently stepped in to prevent any escalation of conflict. A delegation of CONCORD representatives have been seen at the imperial palace at [Dam-Torsad](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Dam-Torsad), while another has been spotted meeting with tribal chiefs.
