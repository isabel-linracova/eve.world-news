_Algogille –_ The [Federation Navy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Federation Navy) has increased the presence of its Tripwire special forces on the Caldari Border Zone as a result of “ongoing turbulence in the [State](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari)”. The increase in forces was first noticed early this morning as the [Federation](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente) moved ships, equipment, and materiel into the border constellation in an effort to detect any early incursion by Caldari forces.

The Federation Navy issued a statement calling the buildup a “normal security precaution” and stated that it expects there to be no escalation of hostilities from the State. “With the continued civil distress in the State, we are merely taking a proactive measure to prevent any incursions,” said a representative.

Meanwhile, there continues to be a lack of news about the whereabouts of [Tibus Heth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth) and his inner circle. Heth was last seen being escorted off-stage following a speech as the audience began to riot. Speculation has run rampant following his disappearance, but the [CEP](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Chief Executive Panel) has denied knowledge of his whereabouts while [Kaalakiota](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kaalakiota Corporation) and the [Caldari Providence Directorate](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Providence Directorate) have yet to comment.
