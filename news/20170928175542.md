Amarr Prime â€“ Loyal capsuleer subjects gathered in great numbers last night to witness the jubilee of Her Most Sublime and Imperial Majesty Catiz I, First Apostle of the True Faith and Sovereign Defender of the Imperial Rite. Cardinal Sourem Itharen, Capsuller Emissary to the Court Chamberlain, gave the loyal address to the assembled capsuleer faithful which we reproduce below:

_Loyal and faithful capsuleers of Amarr! I bring you greetings from the Court Chamberlain on behalf of Her Most Sublime and Imperial Majesty Catiz I, First Apostle of the True Faith and Sovereign Defender of the Imperial Rite.  
  
 On this day we celebrate the auspicious coronation of Her Imperial Majesty and join together as faithful subjects of Most Holy Amarr! Long live the Holy Empress and the Amarr Empire!  
  
 Faithful of Amarr, be it known that I have been enjoined by the Court Chamberlain to address the loyal capsuleers on a matter of great importance to us all.  
  
 By the will of Her Imperial Majesty and Order in the Privy Council, it is declared that the Exhortation to the Faithful by the Supreme Sobor of the Theology Council dated October 11th, YC118 is to be added to Scripture.  
  
 As the faithful will know, this Exhortation by the Theology Council contained the judgment that cloned humans should be accepted as embodying souls in communion with the Imperial Rite.  
  
 On the most wise advice of the Privy Council, Her Imperial Majesty Catiz I has accepted the judgment of the Theology Council and declared that it is included in the Final Law and Scripture of the Amarr Empire.  
  
 As a loyal and faithful capsuleer, given over to service in this cloned form by the call of my duty and order, I rejoiced at this news and know that you too will rejoice even as you praise Her Imperial Majesty's profound wisdom.  
  
 Now, in token of this news and in fealty to our Holy Empress, let us swear anew our vows of obedience, loyalty and faith to the Imperial Throne and Holy Amarr!  
  
 I swear that I shall be ever obedient to the will of the Empress, loyal to the Imperial Throne and faithful to the destiny of Holy Amarr!  
  
 Amarr Victor! Amen! Rejoice, my faithful comrades and enjoy the remainder of this jubilee! Amarr Victor!_

Cardinal Itharen's address was well received by the faithful assembled loyalists and many joined in with the renewal of their vows of obedience, loyalty and faith

The Imperial authorities have noted that attempts to surveil or interfere with the proceedings were made by so-called "Autothysian Lancers" at various points. These attempts were thwarted by the righteous actions of the assembled loyalist capsuleers.

Cardinal Itharen has noted that many petitions have been received by the Court Chamberlain's Office and they will be responded to with all due process and with the speed appropriate to maintaining the dignity of the Imperial Throne.
