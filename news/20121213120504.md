In an unusual occurrence in the afternoon of December 13<sup>th</sup>, a number of individuals throughout New Eden were suddenly accosted by snowball -throwing capsuleers. This unusual group of capsuleers would suddenly appear in a system, declaring their quest for “good snowball fights”. After a few brief exchanges of snowballs launched from the newly distributed Festival Launchers, the capsuleers - spouting off nonsense about “Sansha Claus” and his Revenant pulled by 9 Nightmares - would vanish just as suddenly as they had appeared, leaving behind nothing but some extra snowballs and a few very confused locals.

&nbsp;No injuries were reported from the strange occurrence, though CONCORD later attributed the unusual activities to malfunctioning Slave implants and are seeking out others who may be affected by similar issues.
