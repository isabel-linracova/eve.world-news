Yulai, Genesis – The Minmatar Republic's Ambassador Keitan Yun has presented evidence to CONCORD's Inner Circle indicating that the Equilibrium of Mankind cult is behind several recent dreadnought attacks on planets. Ambassador Yun was accompanied by Hetman General Kanth Filmir, the latter testifying that the evidence was assembled with the co-operation of "loyal Minmatar and allied Gallente capsuleers."

The evidence presented paints a picture of EOM infiltrators in a number of mercenary companies mounting the attacks in Tanoo, Girani-Fa and Tierijev. General Filmir confirmed that the Republic Security Services had managed to penetrate the encryption of a number of logs and encoded data fragments. While in each case the contents of these logs "indicated the mercenaries in question were operating under the orders of national governments" it was determined that the signatures of known EOM encryption and forging methods were in evidence in the recovered materials.

"We strongly believe that the Amarr doomsday cult known as 'the Equilibrium of Mankind' is behind these attacks and is attempting to foment a wider war between the CONCORD powers," stated Ambassador Yun. The Gallente Federation's Ambassador Devan Malate confirmed that the Federal Intelligence Office was analyzing material it had received and that the Federation shared the conclusions of the Minmatar Republic.

Responding for the Amarr Empire, Captain Marshal Sirdan xer Qosh noted that "loyal Amarr capsuleers" had provided evidence from Tanoo that corroborated the indications of EOM involvement after deep analysis by "Amarr inquisitorial authorities." Questioned by Ambassador Yun over "reports of evidence gathered in Floseswin by Amarr paramilitaries", Marshal xer Qosh responded that "such materials have been classified secret due to ongoing military operations in the militia warzone."

The Caldari State's Delegate Akimaka Saraki stated that the position of the Caldari State is that the evidence "shows a clear trail to the Equilibrium of Mankind cult, and our own investigators are pursuing the theory of cult terrorist infiltration into the Expert Intervention mercenary company."

The [Equilibrium of Mankind](https://fiction.eveonline.com/new-eden/lore/equilibrium-of-mankind) are a doomsday cult of Amarr origin that was founded roughly 1,500 years ago by Ocilan Ardishapur, a relative both of the Amarr Emperor of the time and of the head of the Ardishapur Family. The cult is centered around the corrupted teachings of Aramon Khalid, believing that those who do not follow the Equilibrium's way should be exterminated in order to bring about paradise.

Following their distorted beliefs, the EOM have committed several atrocities throughout their history, with the last known major incident thought to be the [destruction of Reschard V's biosphere](https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/planet-wide-explosion-strikes-reschard-v) by an EOM Avatar-class titan.
