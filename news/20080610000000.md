Yulai - The CONCORD Assembly, still reeling from the destruction of its headquarters station in Yulai, has announced the immediate authorization of the "Emergency Militia War Powers Act". This action follows an emergency meeting with all four session members, who petitioned for this section of the charter to be ratified following the drastic events of the day. Fleet Admiral Kasora Neko is reported to have represented the Minmatar Republic.

The War Powers provision of the CONCORD Charter authorizes the "immediate and unconditional formation of capsuleer militias among the nation-state members of the CONCORD Assembly for the purpose of waging uncontested war within the boundaries of Empire space." According to Charter experts, the founders added the emergency provision as a means of absolving CONCORD of any obligation to interfere with combat between nation-states, an act that protects the DED more than anything else.

The militias sanctioned by the Emergency Militia War Powers Act are:

Gallente Federation: Federal Defense Union  
Minmatar Republic: Tribal Liberation Force  
Caldari State: State Protectorate  
Amarr Empire: 24th Imperial Crusade
