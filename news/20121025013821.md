**New Eden** - On November 3 the special anniversary edition of Reality X's EVE Portraits competition will begin.

The competition, which was first held last year, invites capsuleers to submit portraits of themselves, which are then judged for prizes. Entries are currently open for Round 6, which will run from November 3rd until December 1st.

Prizes will include an Iteron Mark IV Quafe Ultramarine Edition as first prize, with the Iteron Mark IV Quafe Ultra Edition and the Iteron Mark IV Amastris Edition as second and third prize respectively.

Capsuleers may browse images of previous winners and other submissions as well as find entry requirements for the contest on Reality X's information portal.

Reality X says, 'My main purpose is to encourage capsuleer creativity. It's what I look for most in a winning portrait.' He also noted that the support from the community has been incredible.
