_Amarr –_ In the wake of [President](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/President) [Jacus Roden's](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jacus Roden) revelation that cloned soldiers have been developed and the [Federation](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente) was beginning a purge of their ranks, [Empress](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr Emperor) [Jamyl I](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jamyl Sarum) announced all those being driven out will have the opportunity to “be embraced by God, be healed by His goodness, and find a new home in the [Empire](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr).”

Speaking from the steps of the Imperial Palace in [Dam-Torsad](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Dam-Torsad), the Empress said, “The Empire does not hate these people because they have found themselves turned from God's light. We have never hated those who have fallen. Instead, we embrace those who have tumbled to the darkest depths and lift them up. It is a long process, but one the Empire is willing to undertake to save these poor souls from those who would so callously discard them.”

The Empress went on to say, “The Empire had experimented with the technology, but early on discovered the flaws that others ignored. However, though we abandoned it, we refuse to abandon those harmed by its implementation. We instead wish to offer them hope. If they come to us, they shall be [Reclaimed](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Reclaiming) into God's service and find a new purpose.

“So come, outcast soldiers, and we shall succor you.”

Though the Empress did not speak with the press, [Court Chamberlain](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Court Chamberlain) [Pomik Haromi](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Pomik Haromi) answered questions on her behalf. According to the Chamberlain, the Empire has “developed an alternative to the cloned soldier technology that has proven free of any taint.”

Additionally, the soldiers will be segregated from the general population on colony worlds where they will receive treatment from the best doctors and scientists of the Empire, while being allowed to pursue worthwhile work on behalf of the Empire. He stated, “Those who are willingly Reclaimed shall not be slaves. We will allow them to live freely within their colonies, alongside their caretakers.”
