J200727 â€“ Several eye witnesses have contacted the Scope in the last hour, concerned about Sisters of EVE presence in the wormhole systems containing the notorious Drifter Hives.&nbsp;

An SOE flotilla has been sighted in J200727, and while this seems an unusual location for SOE operations, this further substantiates a report received by the Scope from an anonymous source.&nbsp; This source claims the Drifters have been researching and constructing new, advanced technology within their wormhole systems and the SOE have managed to retrieve some of that tech.

We have been unable to obtain an official statement from the SOE, but their continued silence on this matter will only fuel the rumor mill.

We will bring you further updates as this story develops.
