Thanks to the valiant defense of the Patch Squad, the advance of the pirates was thwarted in a few heroic battles last night, at least for now. But the hordes of barbarians will probably not be stopped. The Squad is pleading for reinforcements as they continue their fight. Any help will be welcomed.
