CONCORD has released a harsh statement warning against slave trade. The statement is in response to persistent rumors that slaves are becoming increasingly popular as forced labor throughout the world of EVE. CONCORD wants to remind people that slave trade is strictly forbidden everywhere except within Amarr borders and that there are harsh penalties for engaging in human trade. CONCORD ships, and other police forces, may shoot on sight anyone carrying slaves. The Minmatar Republic has also released a statement where they express sadness that the slave trade industry seems to be on the rise and encourages people to stop slave trade wherever it is found, by any means necessary. The Republic itself has taken a strong stance in this and has already attacked and annihilated several slave trader ships.
