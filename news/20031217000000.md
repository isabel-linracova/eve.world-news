Otro Gariushi, CEO of Ishukone has announced that recent discoveries made at the ultra secret Crielere labs are to made freely available to the public.  
  
Lead scientists at Crielere labs today published a detailed white paper describing possible manufacturing methods using a relatively unknown mineral named morphite. Driven by advances in deep core mining, the team has found an economically feasible method of using the mineral, found in mercoxit ore, for mass production. Research agents throughout the known universe are sure to make use of the information given by the science team, to the surprise of many, as it was not expected that the two main funding partners of the Crielere research project, the Caldari State and Gallente Federation, would give their research results out that freely.  
  
Political analysts have been at a loss to explain why the usually secretive CEO is suddenly so keen to share knowledge with the rest of the world. Skeptics claimed that Gariushi is hyping up this invaluable mineral as he intends to profit from the manufacture of deep core mining lasers, known for their below average performance in mining standard ores.
