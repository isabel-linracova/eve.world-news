YULAI – In a statement made roughly an hour ago, DED Director of Operations Arve Vesren confirmed the fate of Dr. Hilen Tukoss after detailed analysis of ship telemetry from a recently discovered site in the uncharted system of J174618.

An expedition led by capsuleers from Itsukame-Zainou Hyperspatial Inquiries Ltd. [IKAME] discovered what is believed to be the corpse of Dr. Tukoss alongside an enormous structure which has also since been identified as that seen in what is believed to be his final broadcast.

The Directive Enforcement Department has since announced that a total of eleven capsuleers will soon receive an Inner Circle Note of Merit as recognition for their work in tracking down there whereabouts of Dr. Tukoss. These capsuleers are:

In the statement made to the Interstellar Press, Director Vesren thanked those involved for their “selfless and intrepid will to locate Dr. Tukoss” and in particular the “outstanding piloting skills of Captain Lucas Raholan, who discovered the remains of the late Dr. Tukoss in J174618.”

She then went on to request that any capsuleers who may have collected biomass from the site hand samples off to the Directive Enforcement Department to allow genetic confirmation of identity for Dr. Tukoss, in order to bring the case to a close.

In closing the statement, Director Vesren declined to comment or give updates on the situation with The Scope and Eifyr and Co, after Eifyr Chief Executive Stawitard Hagirat gave testimony before the Inner Circle on May 20th.

When questioned regarding the status of the cloning contract of Dr. Tukoss, the Directive Enforcement Department also declined to comment, simply adding that Eifyr and Co are cooperating fully with all aspects of the ongoing investigation.
