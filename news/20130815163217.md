KK issued a press release stating Oiritsuu has provided the corporation with a no-interest loan with aims to stabilize its financial reserves and allow it to be aggressive in reclaiming market share lost under the [Heth](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth) regime. According to the terms of the loan, Kaalakiota will make yearly repayments equivalent to a percentage of their operating profits, and will not be responsible for any payments if they operate at a loss.

The risky and unusual loan has been applauded by financial analysts as a bold step toward taking Kaalakiota back toward profitability. “Oiritsuu is basically placing a huge bet on her own ability to steer Kaalakiota into the lead again,” said Haarbin Aigoro, a financial analyst with the [Mercantile Club](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mercantile Club). “It shows a lot of confidence. Investors will respond to that confidence.”

The KK board of directors has also signed off on Oiritsuu's five-year plan, which was described as “aggressive and bold” in a memo issued to shareholders. “The board feels this plan will return Kaalakiota to profitability within a year and to its dominant position atop the Caldari financial world within the span of five years.”

Kaalakiota stock has seen an uptick since the news was released, continuing a trend which began when Oiritsuu was named acting CEO.
