ELORE â€“ Material Acquisition has revealed that its administration of Gallente-districts on Caldari Prime have proven highly profitable, enabling it to open several new facilities throughout the Crux constellation. These facilities are expected to bring millions of jobs to the Gallente economy.

According to the report, the majority of the profit has come from tariffs levied on inter-district trade and travel, with lesser amounts coming from administrative fees and rebuilding contracts. The corporation expects contract profit will drop off as the planet is brought back to full repair, but claims it expects tariffs will rise as further settlers recolonize the planet.
