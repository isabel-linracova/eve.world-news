The 3363 patch has new server interconnects which failed today, resulting in TQ cluster startup failure. Our test cluster did not grab this due to the sheer size difference. We have now deployed a number of fixes and are still monitoring the situation. We have added 1 extra day to all subscriptions and trials will also be extended by one day and we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.
