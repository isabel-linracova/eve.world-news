As research scientists at the half-abandoned Crielere facility brace for another assault by Guristas pirates, academics throughout the universe of EVE are divided in whether they support the somewhat stubborn idealism of Crielere founders Henric Touvolle and Taromi Umailen of refusing to bow to politics and free market pressure. In recent days, a trend has risen amongst engineers working for various corporations and races, to publicize formerly confidential blueprints, and have placed them on the open market for anyone to buy. Both nationalists and military officials ranging from the Amarr Empire to Gallante Federation are criticizing this venture claiming that introducing new combat modules to the market simply escalates the lawlessness that abounds these days and invites more terror by giving criminal elements easy access to advanced technology.  
  
An engineer whose corporation has recently put a new blueprint on the market insisted that criminals already have this technology and it was the common man that gains from this, who until now was not able to defend himself properly.
