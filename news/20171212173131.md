Yulai â€“ CONCORD's Directive Enforcement Department is maintaining a cluster-wide Rogue Swarm Alert due to the continuing presence of large numbers of rogue drone infestations throughout known space.

Rogue drones under the direction of "Swarm Overmind" type drones are repeatedly emerging from deadspace and establishing nests despite the best efforts of capsuleers outfitted with enhanced Alpha Clone capabilities and emergency supplies of military equipment.

It is believed that several million rogue drones have been destroyed in the last 7 days but DED analysts believe that many tens of millions more are being directed by a network of hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of the Swarm Overmind variant drones. It is feared that the ongoing Rogue Swarm invasion attempt may continue for several weeks and require continued vigilance by CONCORD, the empires and independent capsuleers.

Despite the continuing major rogue drone outbreak, preparations for the Yoiul Festival that will mark the end of YC119 and the beginning of YC120 remain on track. However, given the ongoing Rogue Swarm Alert, it is understood that additional security measures are to be funded by order of the Inner Circle.
