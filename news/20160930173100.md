AMARR PRIME – In the final phase of the most sacred rituals of the Amarr Empire, the noble Royal Heirs of the Imperial Houses of Amarr, who served during the reign of Her Imperial Majesty Jamyl I, surrendered their lives in the Rite of Shathol’Syn tonight.

All of Holy Amarr remembers the faith and service of the late noble sovereigns of the Houses of the Privy Council:

 His Royal Highness Aritcio Kor-Azor, Holder of Kor-Azor and Imperial Chancellor  
 His Royal Highness Merimeth Sarum, Holder of the Demesne of Sarum

With the deaths of their noble predecessors, and the ascension of Her Imperial Majesty Catiz I, the Houses of the Privy Council are now led by the newly confirmed sovereign lords of their family domains:

His Royal Highness Arim Ardishapur, Holder of Derelik and the Demesne of Ardishapur
