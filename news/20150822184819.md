Amarr Prime â€“ With the Amarr Empire still reeling from the shock of the Drifter sneak attack that killed Empress Jamyl I, imperial authorities are moving rapidly to ensure an orderly succession process, overseen by Court Chamberlain Pomik Haromi. Under the protocols of the Amarr Empire, the Court Chamberlain is tasked with maintaining continuity of the imperial government while providing for succession to the throne by one of the Royal Heirs.

Speaking from the Imperial Palace in the holy city of Dam-Torsad on Amarr Prime, Lord Pomik Haromi made a brief statement confirming that the succession process would use the traditional trials of champions to determine the next occupant of the Golden Throne of Amarr.&nbsp;

In remarks that signal a return to the normal order of royal successions, Lord Haromi stated, "As there appears to be no immediate choice by the hand of the divine, it is my sacred duty to declare a succession by trials of those champions chosen by the Royal Houses. As prowess in defending Holy Amarr is to the fore of our minds, I would expect paladins from the ranks of our loyal capsuleers to declare themselves available to their liege lords."

The Court Chamberlain concluded his remarks by indicating that the Privy and Theology Councils would be meeting in special conclave to determine the particulars and laws applying to the succession trials.
