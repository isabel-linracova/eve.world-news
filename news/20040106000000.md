Aritcio Kor-Azor, the new head of the Kor-Azor family and son of the recently appointed Amarr Emperor, was involved in an unspecified 'incident' at an ancient cathedral on his home planet of Eclipticum last week. Aritcio, which has a reputation of enjoying the wild side of life, rented the cathedral for himself and a group of his friends to engage in some 'religious festivities', as he described it. These 'festivities' were abruptly ended when a resident priest accidentally walked in on them and witnessed the 'incident'.  
  
Following this 'incident' the cathedral had to be thoroughly cleansed and partly renovated, it has also been revealed that several valuable holy artifacts in the possession of the cathedral had to be destroyed. Naturally, this has upset the religious community on Eclipticum as well as abroad. It is also understood that a foreign exchange student from the Gallente Federation was involved in the 'incident', though it is not known to what extent or purpose. She has already been shipped back to the Federation for medical treatment.  
  
The public relations office of the Kor-Azor family has yet to release a statement on the matter, though one is expected in the very near future.
