POSTOUVIN - The Scope Galactic News Network has reached out to the Society of Conscious Thought in the last hour, after a flotilla of construction vessels began to arrive in close proximity to the stricken Astral Mining RP4 Hemorphite processing installation.

The vessels, which all carry SoCT markings and identification transponders, appear to have commenced the deployment of an Upwell Consortium designed construction scaffold, with numerous jump freighter class vessels arriving to deliver materials and personnel to the site which is within visual distance of the Kyonoke contaminated facility.

Both the Society of Conscious Thought and the press office for the Upwell Consortium, as well as the Federal administration, who would need to approve any construction project in their sovereign territory, have declined to comment on this new development, or what the intention of the construction project may be.
