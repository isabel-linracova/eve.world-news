OIJANEN - The Scope Galactic News Network has learned from contacts in New Caldari that the Chief Executive Panel called an emergency session just moments ago.

The demand for an emergency session mandates the immediate return of the big eight mega corporate CEOs to New Caldari, and comes after extensive testing this week has lead to the confirmation of an outbreak of the Kyonoke Plague in the densely populated city of Myrskaa on Oijanen II.

The State Armed Forces have moved quickly to bolster security around the full closure quarantine cordon that was put in place four days ago, with all access to the city suspended and the site now declared to be under martial law.

In a statement released by Odo Hakaalen, Corporate Relations Director for the Chief Executive Panel, the declaration of a state of emergency was confirmed, along with "the allocation of additional Home Guard and State Peacekeeper troops who are provided to ensure that the quarantine cordon remains in place until such time as the situation is resolved."

Following up on requests for further information on the extent of the outbreak, Director Hakaalen confirmed that "at this point in time, we are still in the process of confirming the exact numbers, however preliminary estimates indicate that there may be as many as one point two million confirmed cases of Kyonoke within the quarantine zone."

When questioned regarding contact with the city, Haakalen confirmed that "The Chief Executive Panel, along with the leadership of the State Armed Forces and all other appropriate divisions of the administration have secure communications access with the relevant authorities and law enforcement divisions inside the zone.

At this time, for reasons of operational security, a full communications blackout has been initiated, and will remain in place across all non-military channels to maintain the integrity of the quarantine zone."

After being pressed for further information regarding the condition and status of Oijanen II, Haakalen concluded his press conference by stating that "the customs office in orbit of Oijanen II is at appropriate distance from the city for it to remain open, and any capsuleers or corporate entities who maintain installations on the surface will still be permitted access to their facilities at this time.

There may however be delays during the import and export process, with additional security and HAZMAT screening in place to ensure proper security."

It is expected that the Chief Executive Panel will meet in the coming hours, after the short notice return of Ishukone CEO Mens Reppola from an inspection visit on Caldari Prime, in the Federal system of Luminaire.
