Dam-Torsad, Amarr Prime â€“ The new Empress of Amarr will be Her Majesty Catiz Tash-Murkon, following her Champion Kelon Darklight's triumph in the Finals of the Imperial Succession Trials today. Long, loud and clear was the pealing of bells in celebration, as crowds gathered in the Imperial City of Dam-Torsad witnessed the victory in ritual combat of the Tash-Murkon capsuleer Champion Lord Kelon Darklight and his retainers, Lucian IV, Maxine Antilles and Wasa Qc.

The battle to determine the next occupant of the Golden Throne of Holy Amarr was hard fought indeed. The combats of the final trials went through the full five bouts provided for by the rules of the Amarr Championship. The Champions Lysus and Kelon Darklight led their teams of retainers with distinction and honor. In the final combat, however, though their undefeated run had been broken by the fierce resolve of the Kor-Azor team, the fighters on behalf of Catiz Tash-Murkon won out and established Her Majesty's right undoubted to ascend the Throne and rule over the Amarr Empire.

With the right of succession to the Golden Throne secured by Catiz Tash-Murkon, her coronation can now be planned. This Tash-Murkon victory also means that the Heirs of the other five Royal Houses must now prepare themselves for the Rite of Shathol'Syn, the ritual suicide of the Heirs of the remaining Houses following the coronation of a new Empress. The Heirs-elect of the Six Royal Houses can now begin their final preparations to assume their places as the new Royal Heirs and leaders over their portion of the nobility, peoples and territories of Holy Amarr.

While the coronation of the new Empress will be of greatest importance for the Amarr Empire and New Eden in general, tonight belongs to Lord Kelon Darklight and his team of retainers. Amidst the celebrations marking the dawning of a new age for the Amarr Empire, the Imperial Champion and his comrades are the toast of Dam-Torsad. As Imperial Champion, Lord Kelon Darklight will be inducted into the Cross of the Sacred Throne Order by the new Empress and the entire team will receive Gold Magnate class frigates.

_Long Live the Empress! Amarr Victor!_
