_Piak â€“_ With [Tibus Heth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/) a fugitive, [Caldari Constructions](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Constructions) has announced it will convene a shareholder's vote to nullify his shares in the company. It anticipates this vote will be finalized within a month.

Under Caldari Constructions corporate law, an individual who is unable to exercise their duties as a shareholder and has no designated heir or representative to assume control of those shares may have their share ownership nullified by vote. This provision of corporate law is rarely invoked and, when done, is typically voted down. Due to the unusual circumstances surrounding this vote, it is expected to comfortably pass.

The nullification of the shares will allow the corporation to move forward on several important decisions, including replacing Heth as CEO. This vote is expected to occur in economic quarter 4.
