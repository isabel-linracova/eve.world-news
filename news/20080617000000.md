Avair - Revealing the results of their extended discussion on the matter, the Theology Council has announced its acceptance of Chamberlain Hemirin's request to declare Jamyl Sarum Empress-elect and hold a coronation ceremony "as soon as is practicable".

After being ensconced in their chambers for nearly a day, the Council finally reconvened to announce its support of Hemirin's position. Acceding to the other Heirs' requests to be withdrawn from consideration, and accepting the legitimacy of Sarum's claim, it acknowledged that as the sole remaining candidate the only acceptable course of action was to declare her Empress-elect and proceed with the coronation. It declined to pass any comment on the circumstances of Sarum's return, stating simply that "there is no acceptable explanation of [her return] available to us at this time".

While Articio Kor-Azor, Catiz Tash-Murkon and Uriam Kador fielded questions and commended the Council on "a difficult decision handled expertly", the Justices of the Council filed out swiftly as soon as the announcement was completed, followed shortly after by Yonis Ardishapur, who elected to dispense with the customary speech following decisions of such magnitude. On being pressed for comment by members of the press, Ardishapur Family Chief Co-Ordinator Bedaliba Izon attempted to deflect questions but after further consideration and some deliberation agreed to make a short statement. He expressed his support of the individual men and women of the Theology Council, declaring that they had "the fortitude to make a very serious decision in an unfavorable and highly pressured environment, the wisdom to know which choice would be the best one for the ancient and glorious Empire, and the intelligence to make a decision following their heads rather than their hearts", and then swiftly exited the hall.
