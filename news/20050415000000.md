Special Counsel Tar Maurisi, head of the CEP Business Bureau's investigation into the Ullia Hnolku disappearance, at a press conference this morning revealed some of the latest discoveries made by the investigative committee. Chief among these was information brought to light by a report which had found its way from an anonymous source in Zainou's main labs.  
  
The report, four pages long, begins by detailing progress on a few projects under development at the laboratories, after which it delves into the subject of Insorzapine bisulfate and the company's attempts to reproduce it. According to Maurisi, at several points the report indicates that, in fact, the mutagen binder is "not as dangerous as the public has been led to believe."  
  
The Special Counsel went on to reveal excerpts from the report:  
  
p. 2: "_Half-life testing on Insorzapine-4 has shown that two of the compound's breakdown elements, at RTT 1.6 and 1.8, exceed the CPRC's 0.4% limit. Since the bisulfate variant was lost we have made some steps backward in the safety dept, but as of yet protective gear has not been deemed required by staff._"  
  
p. 3: "_... and we feel that in order to reduce toxicity to the levels evidenced by preliminary Insorzapine bisulfate tests, a greater emphasis needs to be placed on development of non-covalent binding patterns and ionic channel receptivity._"  
  
Maurisi went on to state that "this apparently willful misrepresentation of facts by Zainou will be investigated to the full extent possible." When asked as to his thoughts on why the biotech giant would exaggerate the danger posed by the drug, the Special Counsel replied "Well, that's what we're here to find out, isn't it?"
