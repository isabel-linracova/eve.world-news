DAM-TORSAD – Watched by trillions of viewers across the cluster, the second stage of the Imperial Succession Trials concluded today, eliminating four of the Royal Heirs to the Imperial Throne from competition, and setting the stage for a grand finale in early YC118.

While the Imperial Succession Committee remains tight lipped regarding the exact format for the finals of the Succession Trials, it is now known that [Lord Darklight](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Kelon%20Darklight), champion for House Tash-Murkon, will face off against [Lord Lysus](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Lysus), Champion for house Kor-Azor, after remaining undefeated throughout the trials.

While initially thought to be ruled out of the finals after a shaky start to the trials, the Champion for Lord Aritcio Kor-Azor secured a face off at the finals against House Tash-Murkon after a miraculous comeback that saw victory against the well-established [Champion of House Ardishapur](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/SoulLess%20Zealot).

Victory against House Sarum by [Lady Damassys Kadesh](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Damassys%20Kadesh), Champion for House Khanid, saw the Champion of Merimeth Sarum, [Lady Mitara Newelle](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Mitara%20Newelle)&nbsp;eliminated, securing the final for House Kor-Azor.

Still sequestered under the supervision of the Order of St. Tetrimon within the Imperial City of Dam-Torsad, there has been no official response from the six royal heirs. However, sources from within the Imperial Palace have indicated that the six Heirs viewed this weekend's trials&nbsp;together, in good spirit, with only a short break from Lord Aritcio Kor-Azor to attend to personal affairs.

Today's events&nbsp;set the scene for the final of the Amarr Succession Trials, which will take place in the second quarter of YC118 between the Champions of House Kor-Azor and House Tash-Murkon, deciding&nbsp;which of the two remaining Heirs will ascend to the Imperial Throne.
