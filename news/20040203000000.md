The Caldari State and the Gallente Federation have finally officially decided to abandon the Crielere research facilities, something that has been expected for quite some time. Most of the staff has already left and security personnel and police ships will leave the system in the very near future. The rift caused by the theft of valuable blueprints by high ranking Caldari officials has grown so deep and severe that it was quite obvious that the two great nations could not continue their cooperation in the Crielere program, despite the grand successes it had achieved. Thus, it was only a matter of time before the program would collapse completely.  
  
 But not all are willing to abandon the vision around which the Crielere program was created. The two leading scientists in the program, Touvolle and Umailen, have refused to leave the facility and have secured themselves along with a handful of loyal followers in a single lab in the vast complex. There they intend to continue the work they started, regardless of what the empires wish. Whether the pair can manage to stay alive without any kind of support is another matter all together.
