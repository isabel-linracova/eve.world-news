SOMER Blink, New Eden's most popular instant lottery, are hosting yet another landmark celebration - this one in honor of having handed out over 900 trillion ISK (the actual current number at time of writing is 915,434,170,395,168 ISK) in prizes.

The celebration includes free gifts - capsuleers who had registered a Blink account before the celebration commenced may redeem free gifts and the chance for any prize to be doubled. The event ends Tuesday, 16 July 2013.

The grand prize for this celebration is the Bonk event. Prizes for this activity include a Mastodon BPO for the first place and 100 PLEX for second. Third place receives a Freki with the corpse of CCP Nullarbor, a one-of-a-kind collector's item. Other prizes include a Station Outpost Egg, winner's choice supercapital BPOs, and the original blueprints for a full set of capital ship components.

There is also the Blast event, where participants receive tickets for taking part in regular activities. At the end of the celebration, five tickets will be drawn, with each winner receiving 50 billion ISK.

SOMER Blink has been running for almost three years, having opened their doors in September 2010, and have been going 365 days a year since then. They currently have over thirty employees handling deliveries, deposit processing and prize delivery.
