Our sources claim that several steps have been taken within local and galactic law enforcement agencies to address the recent tide of piracy and criminal activities within the boundaries of empire space. High ranking officials within Concord and army officers have denied to comment on any details regarding these operations, as this would compromise the safety of their military and staff, but state that naturally they will do all they can to ensure the safety of all civilians and space travelers within the empires.
