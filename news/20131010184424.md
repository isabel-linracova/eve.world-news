_Okagaiken_ – Ships whose transponder callsigns match those of [Tibus Heth](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth) and other [Provist](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Providence Directorate) loyalists who'd escaped the Haatomo siege were detected in the Okagaiken system of [Black Rise's](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Black Rise (lore)) Urpiken constellation. the [Caldari Navy](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Navy) has reported. The Navy immediately scrambled a task force to intercept Heth's ship, but they were unable to locate any trace of it after a 24-hour search.

The Navy has deployed further forces to Urpiken in an effort to track down Heth, but [Federal Defence Union](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Federal Defence Union) occupation of several systems in the constellation have hampered efforts. The Navy has urged Caldari loyalists to be diligent and immediately report any sightings of Heth or ships piloted by members of the [Templis Dragonaurs](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Templis Dragonaurs).
