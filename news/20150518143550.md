In an effort to bring you more information about your friends and neighbors, as well as enemies and rivals, we introduce the next in our semi-regular "Corporation Spotlight" series.

This edition’s corporation in the spotlight is Theoretical Heresy (founded 2011.07.05) of the Fatal Ascension alliance. IC had the opportunity to speak with the CEO Maidas Mulligan.

Fatal Ascension is one of the larger 0.0 alliances, and is currently in the process of a controlled withdrawal from 0.0 pending its dissolution. As they withdraw Brave is taking over much of the Fountain region.

The corporation is currently a jack-of-all-trades, mainly based in null sec.

The corporation is currently not recruiting. If recruiting opens again, they indicate that they will be looking for subcap pilots with a military background, preferably against hostile capsuleers. Focus will be on capital pilots, and capsuleers with industry experience.

In the past some people joined the corporation because they wanted sovereign space to put up a tower and build, others wanted to have a group to mine and have fun with, and some just enjoyed socialising with the crew.

The corporation is currently evacuating the Fountain region to assist in solidifying their coalition’s position elsewhere in the cluster; “The Imperium is contracting to defensive positions. The coalition has a lot of people up north and Fountain, while profitable, may not be very defensible after the new environmental changes coming in June,” Maidas Mulligan explained.

Maidas Mulligan is looking forward to consolidating within The Imperium (formerly the CFC) and wanted to thank the Imperium coalition’s corporation diplomatique who have been “wonderful” with helping the corporation find a new place to live. The response the CEO has gotten from alliances he reached out to have been overwhelmingly supportive.
