_Usi -_ Seven Provist Chimeras and one Wyvern were destroyed in Usi by a force of over 1000 capsuleers. The Wyvern, piloted by Kossen Jaikka, was destroyed after a little over an hour of fighting. The Caldari Navy has confirmed kills on all members of the renegade 'Octopus' Squadron members who had absconded with the capital ships, bringing an end to the massive manhunt which has captured attention over the past week.

The battle seemed to favor the Provist forces at the beginning, as even several hundred capsuleers were unable to overwhelm the remote shield boosting capabilities of the capital ships. Numerous ships were lost to the drones and fighters deployed by the Provists. However, eventually capsuleer forces reached a critical mass where they were able to overwhelm even the repair capabilities of the carriers. One by one, the carriers began to fall, and as their remote assistance capabilities diminished, so too did the ability for the Provists to mount any sort of defense. Though stray ships continued to be picked off by drones and fighters, the Wyvern fell to sustained fire.

"The operation was a major success," said Wing Commander Hikemi Korrado. "Though we had issues with capsuleers defending the Provists in past engagements, in this one we were lucky... It seems their criminal allies in Pandemic Legion were unable to enter Usi in force due to CONCORD restrictions."

Despite Korrado's praise, a group of unaffiliated capsuleers calling themselves "Spectre Fleet" attempted to offer aide to the Provists, but it ultimately proved futile in the chaotic fighting.

The bounties will be paid out on the 23rd, pending final confirmation from Caldari Navy officials. Currently, the tally for this final engagement stands as follows:
