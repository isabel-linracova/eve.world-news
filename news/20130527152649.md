_New Caldari –_ Speaking for the first time since [Caldari Navy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Navy) Executive Officer Mininela Erinen testified that he forced Admiral Visera Yanala to undergo the [Tea Maker Ceremony](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tea Maker Ceremony), a harried [Tibus Heth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth) attempted to apologize for and defend his actions. Before he could finish, the assembled crowd broke into a riot and forced Heth off stage.

Rather than broadcasting the speech from a secured location, Heth chose to speak before assembled workers for [Caldari Constructions](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Constructions). He began by saying, “Loyal Caldari citizens, I come before you today to address the testimony delivered to the [Chief Executive Panel](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Chief Executive Panel) two days ago. It is with a heavy heart that I must tell you the testimony is, while over dramatized and colored with bias, essentially true.”

The crowd began to grow rowdy, though Heth attempted to continue speaking over them. “It is with great sadness that I reveal this information to you. I acted only in the best interests of the [State](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari) in making this decision. Admiral Yanala informed me she disobeyed a direct order and allowed her ship to be destroyed by [Gallente](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente) forces. She showed no remorse for her actions and was defiant in front of both myself and the Navy's executive officer.

“In light of her treasonous actions, I gave her a final act to prove her honor by drinking the hak'len tea. She did so and the [Maker](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari_spirituality) did not protect her, so her life was forfeit. It was only later, after the CEP and Caldari Navy investigated further, that it was revealed that the battle was a lost cause and Admiral Yanala had acted to preserve lives.

“I admit I acted with haste. But a leader must act decisively in such situations. I regret my actions in retrospect, but Visera - ”

At this point, a member of the crowd hurled a bottle at the stage. Provist security immediately leapt into the crowd to detain the perpetrator, but the crowd broke into a riot and began assaulting the guards. Heth momentarily attempted to appeal for calm, but was quickly whisked off stage by his handlers. Order was restored shortly after by [Provists](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Providence Directorate) and law enforcement, with 23 reported wounded, including one in critical condition.

Heth has made no statement since the riot, while a full board meeting of the [Chief Executive Panel](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Chief Executive Panel) has been called.
