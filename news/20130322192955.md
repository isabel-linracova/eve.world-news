BREAKING NEWS – It has been confirmed in the last ten minutes that a large section of the _Shiigeru’s_ superstructure has made impact with the southern tip of the Kaalakiota mountain range, approximately 700 kilometers west of the city of Arcurio.

All contact has been lost with the surface of Caldari Prime for the third time today, after an electromagnetic surge caused by the impact destroyed communications equipment and additionally destabilized the shields of several vessels in low orbit.

The last holoreel recordings to be transmitted from the surface display a superheated trail of burning wreckage thousands of kilometers in length that tore across the sky above Arcurio. Reports coming in from the surface of the planet at the time suggested the remains of the Shiigeru had begun to break up before impact, with the concussion wave as it passed over the city causing widespread cosmetic damage to most structures, and the collapse of several high-rise buildings in the central business district.

The situation on the surface of Caldari Prime remains unclear at present, due to massive atmospheric distortion and a dust cloud that covers several hundred thousand square kilometers, obscuring the entire city of Arcurio and most of the southern Kaalakiota Mountains.

Both CONCORD and Federation Navy Commander Anteson Ranchel have issued orders against any vessels attempting an approach on Caldari Prime. The office of press for the Federation Navy has declared Caldari Prime a Federal disaster zone as the battle for orbital superiority continues.
