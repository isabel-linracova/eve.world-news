**Umokka, Lonetrek** - The fourth annual New Year's Fireworks Celebration, hosted by Daggaroth and New Eden Radio, is set to kick off at 23:00 UTC, 31 December, in Umokka, outside the Caldari Navy Testing Facilities at the fourth moon of Umokka X.

Last year's event was a rousing success, with local peaking at 1800, and this year is expected to bring even more capsuleers to watch and participate.

As usual, anyone in possession of a working laser turret or missile launcher is welcome to attend, and of course Festival Launchers sporting the new fireworks will be most welcome. New Eden Radio will be hosting a dedicated show during the event.

There will also be numerous competitions going on throughout the event, including raffles for a Moros and three Chimeras. Anyone hoping to contribute prizes or ISK should contact Daggaroth via EVE mail.
