Great Caravanserai, Matar – The Minmatar Tribal Council issued a call today for candidates from all seven tribes of the Minmatar to apply to a new capsuleer recruitment program of the Republic Fleet. It is believed the program will use the recently revealed new cloning technology, which Minmatar sources say considerably widens the pool of viable candidates for capsule adaptation.

The Tribal Council has recently been meeting more frequently and regularly than usual in closed session to "discuss matters of interstellar security and current challenges facing the Minmatar people". Matters for discussion are believed to include the so-called "Drifter Crisis", the recent spate of attacks by Blood Raider Convenant and Sani Sabik cultist forces, and the continuing issues of the border war and "slaver crimes" relating to the Amarr Empire.

In other Minmatar news, there are reports that some adherents of the pantheistic hybrid of Amarr religion and Minmatar spiritualism have adopted something known as "The Way of Ephesianos", apparently based on the writings of a capsuleer member of the noted Minmatar freedom fighter alliance, Ushra'Khan.

The news comes at a time of increased non-tribal cult activity on Matar and other Minmatar planets, involving Sani Sabik sects, Salvation Church of Blessed Servitude branches and various “fusion faiths”, apparently in response to recent interstellar events.
