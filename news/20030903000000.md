The Secure Commerce Commission has taken drastic measures against illegal copying of blueprints. Since the copy laws where changed recently, SCC has tracked down numerous cases where people are still using the old regulations for blueprint copying. SCC will start installing restrictions in appliance with the new laws on blueprints used in illegal copying. This will eject them from their lab slots, but will not otherwise affect them, apart from the new restrictions already mentioned.
