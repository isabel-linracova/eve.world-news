Luminaire - **Update** - Raging ethnic violence on Caldari Prime took a turn for the worse as Federation police opened fire on rioting Caldari expatriates. Although there are conflicting reports about the specific circumstances surrounding the incident, reliable sources claim the decision to use force was made following the shooting death of a Federation police officer. Camera drones on site are recording imagery of groups of young males attacking Federation establishments as owners return fire. Municipal police forces are erecting barricades around businesses and private property. Although local politicians have appealed for calm, the death toll is estimated to be in the hundreds, with at least twice as many casualties.
