We'll deploy a patch on **Wednesday** , 13 December, to address issues such as Salvage loot drops and Rigs, Shipwreck UI improvements (if a wreck contains loot or not, plus overview filtering), balancing in system scanning of deadspace in agents/complexes (way too easy) and exploration (way too hard and easier escalation), re-seeding a number of Tech 2 blueprints, and finally, improvments to server performance and stability. We'll also replace some faulty hardware resulting in an improvement in general performance.

The patch and maintenance deployment time is scheduled for four hours.
