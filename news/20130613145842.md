_Caldari Prime –_ The family of deceased [Caldari Navy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Navy) Admiral Visera Yanala held a private funeral on [Caldari Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Prime) last evening. The family turned down a military funeral with full honors for the posthumously honored war hero, instead opting for a private ceremony with limited guests. CEOs of several megacorps attended, while those who did not sent representatives.

The family released a statement saying, “We appreciate the offer to provide Visera with a military funeral. She died serving the [State](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari) and the Caldari people. But she never wished for glory. She was never the type who did something to earn attention for herself. We believe she would have wished for her funeral to be a private affair with those who knew her best. However, given the public nature of her final hours and the overwhelming support given by the [CEP](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Chief Executive Panel) to uncovering the truth of her death, we have extended an invitation to each megacorp to send a representative to share in our memories of her before we return her to the [Cold Wind](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Spirituality#Cold Wind) of the Kaalakiota Peaks.”

Reporters were not allowed in attendance. Notable attendees include [Ishukone](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ishukone Corporation) CEO Mens Reppola, [Hyasyoda](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Hyasyoda Corporation) CEO Ahtonen Osmon, [Lai Dai](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Lai Dai Corporation) CEO Alakoni Ishanoya, [CBD](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/CBD Corporation) CFO Kentanen Shinagimi, [Wirykomi](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Wirykomi Corporation) Chief of Staff Saakkimuka Ishaken, and former [Kaalakiota](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kaalakiota Corporation) CEO Haatakan Oiritsuu. The family had Admiral Yanala cremated and subsequently scattered her ashes on the Kaalakiota Peaks, within view of the wreckage of the _Shiigeru_.
