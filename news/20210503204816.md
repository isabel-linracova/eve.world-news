Tierijev, Verge Vendor â€“ The squadron of Phoenix-class dreadnoughts bombarding the planet Tierijev IV are reported to have been destroyed by a Federation Navy fleet, EDENCOM's AEGIS units and capsuleer forces in another pitched battle in orbit of a world threatened by mass destruction from space.

Reports indicate that the dreadnoughts were carrying the indentifiers of the Expert Intervention mercenary corporation, a PMC with links to the Nugoeihuvi megacorporation and its Internal Security corporate military. Damage reports are unclear but the Federation defense complex on the surface of Tirerijev IV is believed to have raised its defenses rapidly and warded off most missiles. Others have struck randomly in the surrounding region, with an unconfirmed report claiming an automated mega-plantation dedicated to high-yield wheat crops has been hit by at least one warhead.

The news from New Caldari Prime has been dominated by the destruction of the tip of the CEP's primary spire in Landfall City. CEP Chairman Puok Kossinen remains unaccounted for but the 'Big 8' megacorporation CEOs have been stated to be "safe, secure and holding a CEP meeting by remote holographic comms." The Caldari State's Inner Circle Delegate, Akimaka Saraki, has requested a full meeting of the Inner Circle after his own conference with several of the Big 8 CEOs. The Federation's Ambassador Devan Malate has joined the call for a meeting, and the Amarr Empire and Minmatar Republic delegates are understood to be enroute after reporting to their own governments over the weekend.
