Dear players, After today's patch, several issues have come up, mostly related to new players stuck in low security systems. We have been able to address many of them through petitions, but due to the sheer volume we have decided to change game logic temporarily. Pirates will therefore no longer infest jumpgates. After today we will gradually increase pirate infestation of low security systems because they are intended to be just that.  
  
 This change will unfortunately require a server reboot. Therefore we will be rebooting the servers at 18:00 GMT. They should be back up again at 18:30. Our deepest appologies for the inconvenience and the hardship these troubles have caused today. Best regards, The EVE Online Team
