High-ranking CONCORD officials have accused several prominent Caldari weapon manufacturers of promoting war and violence in many parts of the world. The Caldari armament industry has in recent years increasingly turned its eyes outside the State to do business, as the domestic market dwindles. Though most of these exports go to legitimate sources it is estimated that as much as 20% ends up in the hands of the less scrupulous social elements.   
  
CONCORD has many times in the past issued stern warnings to several Caldari corporations regarding trade with unsavory entities, reminding them that there are regulations that forbid such dealings. Yet the trade continues, often disguised as aid relief or sample containers. It has become clear that as long as the powers that be within the Caldari State turn a blind eye on this situation, then there is little that CONCORD can do to remedy it.
