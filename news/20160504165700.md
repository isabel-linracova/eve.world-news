Dam-Torsad, Amarr Prime â€“ The Amarr Empire's Imperial Succession Committee has announced that the coronation of Empress Catiz I will be take place on September 27th YC118. Court Chamberlain Pomik Haromi, speaking on behalf of the Succession Committee said, "The course of Holy Amarr has been set with the triumph of Her Majesty Catiz I in the trials. The coronation of the Empress will be carried out in the normal manner with all due rites and before the assembled faithful of Amarr. Preparations have begun and we look forward to the great moment when the ascension of our Empress will be sanctified for all to witness."

The Order of St. Tetrimon continues to watch over the outgoing Royal Heirs of Houses Ardishapur, Kador, Khanid, Kor-Azor and Sarum. Following the established traditions of the Rite of Shathol'Syn, the Heirs will fulfil their final oaths of faith on the order of the newly crowned Empress.

Reactions to the victory of Her Majesty Catiz I have been uniformly joyful across the length and breadth of Holy Amarr. Celebration holidays are still in effect in many domains and the banners of the Emperor Family and House Tash-Murkon fly alongside one another across the Empire. The Royal Heirs-elect pledged their fealty at the ceremonies of the Succession Trials and now begin the process of taking full control of their House domains, before renewing their pledges as full Heirs of the Royal Houses of Amarr following the coronation of Empress Catiz I.

Interstellar reactions among the CONCORD powers have been much as expected. Chairman Puok Kossinen of the Chief Executive Panel of the Caldari State welcomed the news of the Empress's triumph. "The Caldari State expects to maintain its productive and mutually respectful relationship with the great Amarr Empire. We particularly welcome and look forward to the opportunity to work with a leader of such acumen and foresight as Empress Catiz."

President Jacus Roden had been quick to express his appreciation of Her Majesty's victory during his visit to Dam-Torsad for the final trials, while reflecting on the immeasurable loss of Empress Jamyl I. "It has been my sad duty to attend the funeral of one empress and I am pleased to be able to say that I look forward to the duty of witnessing another empress take up the reins of leadership at Catiz Tash-Murkon's coronation. Our great nations often disagree but I believe we have a shared interest in stability and security during these turbulent times."

The Minmatar Republic restricted itself to reiterating its current stance towards the Amarr Empire, as a representative of the Republic Parliament stated, "The Tribal Republic's policy towards the Empire remains unchanged by this development. If the new Empress declares a policy of total manumission of all slaves in the Empire, we would then have a basis for establishing positive relations. Until then, we remain unimpressed." Scenes on the streets of Minmatar cities were characterized by barbaric acts of burning effigies and bizarre pantomiming of lewd acts.

The Society of Conscious Thought has made no comment despite its claim to equivalent status as a CONCORD power.
