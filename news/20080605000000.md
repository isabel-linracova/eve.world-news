Illuin - Brutor party leader Maleatu Shakor called an emergency parliament session in which he demanded a vote of no-confidence in Karin Midular's government. The parliament head delivered a fiery speech denouncing the beleaguered prime minister, citing the Archangel-Skarkon debacle, the futility of her appeasement doctrine with Amarr, and finally the Starkmanir discovery and her subsequent pledge for a "cooperative" recovery solution. The packed session quickly turned violent as parliament members confronted each other as they rushed to cast their vote. Although largely symbolic, the end tally showed overwhelming support for the no-confidence measure, which could prove to be the final nail in the political coffin of Karin Midular.

Shakor, a long-time rival of the prime minister, is considered a primary candidate to replace her in a general election. The capsuleer is known for being the most vocal hawk in the Minmatar Republic, demanding a "zero-tolerance" policy of slavery towards Amarr.
