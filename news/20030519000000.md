The problem with the second agent often being in some distant low-security solar system is now fixed. To allow everybody a chance at a new agent, we have reopened the tutorial kill mission again for all who have completed it. To acquire a new agent, go to your starting agent and complete the tutorial kill mission again. You will retain your previously acquired agent(s) as well.
