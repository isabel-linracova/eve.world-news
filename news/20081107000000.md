Tash-Murkon - Approximately 200 Amarrian warships were detected moving through the Tash-Murkon Region earlier today in what is being described by analysts as a training exercise by the Imperial Fleet. Although no official statement has been released by the Ministry of War, the movement of such a large number of purely Amarr-class vessels "could be nothing else" according to military strategists familiar with Imperial Navy operations.

The Tash-Murkon family spokesman expressed concern over the developments. "We have not been informed of any exercises by the Ministry of War," he said. "We would like to think they would have the courtesy to inform us before moving such a large number of ships through our space."
