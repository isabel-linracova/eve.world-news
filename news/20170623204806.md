AMARR - The Scope has learned that Lady Hamideh Kador has arrived in the Imperial capital of Dam-Torsad a little over an hour ago for an audience with Empress Catiz I.

The audience - which is not listed on the public roster of engagements for the Empress - appears to have been arranged at short notice, and sources within the Empire indicate that it relates to security concerns surrounding a substantial increase in foreign traffic passing through the Fua constellation of Domain, which borders the region of Kador on two fronts.

The influx of through traffic in the constellation has been attributed to a large increase in Federal registered non-capsuleer vessels utilizing a route through the constellations of Fua and Yekti to reach the border with The Citadel. This allows traders and hauliers to bypass the restricted Caldari-Gallente border which has been in a state of partial lockdown since March 22nd.

Several experts at The Scope have commented that this meeting is not seen as a surprise to many political commentators, given that a total of seven strike wings from the Kador Family's standing fleet were dispatched to the Megeh and Pezarba constellations of Kador in mid-April to monitor the border chokepoints of Mod and Hiroudeh.

Speaking from within the region of Kador itself, our Scope security correspondent, Lolie Arbirelle commented that "it would appear that Lady Kador is seeking an audience with the Empress in order to discuss security concerns surrounding the use of the Empire's border systems as a bypass, which has caused a downturn in trade in the area, as well as a notable increase in piracy and opportunistic attacks by the Blood Raider Covenant in the lowsec constellation of Pezarba."

At this stage, there has been no official word from Amarr or the Kador family regarding the reasoning for Lady Kador's trip to the Imperial Palace.

The Scope will continue to report on the situation as it develops.
