_Nonni –_ In an address given to [Kaalakiota](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kaalakiota Corporation) workers, [State](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari) Executor [Tibus Heth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth) pointed at the recent hacker attack on a [Black Eagles](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Black Eagles) installation as proof that the [Federation](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente) is “in a state of barely concealed chaos” which presents a “significant risk to the security of the Caldari State.” According to Heth, “The Federation is a viper perched on a rotten branch. Eventually that branch will snap and drop it right onto our heads.”

“Already we see the cracks beginning to form,” he went on. “They have hackers directly attacking their government agencies. And if Blaque and his cohorts have their way, they'll stop at nothing short of the complete annihilation of the Caldari people. Already they have begun poisoning us with their venom, corrupting our executives, and turning them against us. Where will they go next?”

The speech, which was characterized as “disjointed” by some observers, continued for several minutes. “The State must remain vigilant against our enemies. We have already seen they can come from within. Even those we believe to be allies might remain distant when we need them most. We must stand on our own feet to fight those who want to destroy us.”

Apparently, the speech was then cut short abruptly. A few in the crowd said Heth appeared to suffer from a sudden sharp pain and was hurriedly escorted off stage by [Provists](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Providence Directorate). A representative then took the microphone and informed the crowd that Heth had been called away on critical matters.

The reception for the entire speech was viewed as supportive, though many noted it was rather muted compared to prior ones.
