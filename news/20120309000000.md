The long running capsuleer organisation [Red vs. Blue](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=6408&find=unread) has over the past week seen unprecedented growth, increasing in membership by over a third. This news has been met with enthusiasm by the industrialists of their home region of Lonetrek, where demand for ships, modules and ammunition is at an all-time high. DED records for February show the organisation to be behind more ship losses within New Eden than any other, destroying 10,500 vessels that month alone.

Red Vs. Blue is dedicated to maintaining a non-political atmosphere with [no entry requirements](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&t=6408) for interested capsuleers, and is widely considered to be one of the most efficient ways for aspiring pilots to gain combat experience. &nbsp;These policies, along with their relatively free-for-all system based largely on smaller and inexpensive vessels have seen increasing numbers of capsuleers joining.
