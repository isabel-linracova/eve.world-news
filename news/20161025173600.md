New Caldari â€“ Leading megacorporations Kaalakiota and Sukuuvestaa have announced they are providing technical, logistical and material support to the Caldari Navy, "in order to facilitate the most rapid uptake of advances in cloning technology for the security of the Caldari people and the preservation of our way of life".

Usually positioned as great rivals in the complex corporate politics of the Caldari State, the Kaalakiota and Sukuuvestaa megacorps are generally considered to be the most powerful players in their respective [corporate factions](https://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/state-factionalism/): the Patriots and the Practicals. While the attention of the so-called Liberals bloc, led by the Ishukone megacorp, has been focused on the redevelopment of Caldari Prime and expanding interstellar trade, the megacorps of the Patriots and Practicals have been engaged in considerable efforts to diversify and develop their interests within the Caldari State.

Some observers of Caldari State politics believe that a nascent corporate war is "bubbling under the surface", as Iesa Murikomo, host of popular Caldari news show _This Is The State_, puts it. The last 12 months have seen a noticeable increase in acts of sabotage, piracy and sanctioned, while limited, corporate warfare within the State's borders and involving its extraterritorial interests.

For their part, the Kaalakiota and Sukuuvestaa megacorps have stated their "total commitment to supporting the institutions of the State and the vibrant competitiveness of corporate life, the very foundation of our people's prosperity". The Caldari Navy has confirmed its "close co-operation with the respected and vital Kaalakiota and Sukuuvestaa Corporations" and expressed "deep support" for the leading role all Caldari megacorps are taking in "enhancing the security of the State through their corporate security forces' cloning programs".
