Dear players, this is a very sad announcement we have to make. Ever since the patch at 12:00 GMT yesterday we have had serious issues with several aspects of the game. We have spent the better part of today in an effort to set things right but since the consequences of these issues, especially an exploit involving excessive insurance payout, are of a magnitude we cannot overlook we have decided to turn back the clock and roll back the state of the game to the way it was before applying the patch. This will be done at 04:30 GMT tonight. This in effect will mean that all playtime from that point until now will be lost. As means of compensation we will be transferring the sum of 200.000 isk to all of you. We understand that your loss is great and please believe this is not something we take lightly.
