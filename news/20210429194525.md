Girani-Fa, Genesis â€“ Multiple Moros-class dreadnoughts of the Crux Special Tasks Group are reported to have arrived in orbit of Girani-Fa III and to have commenced an orbital bombardment of the planet.

Girani-Fa is noted as a border system that has been the subject of past dispute between the Amarr Empire and Gallente Federation, though the issue of the system's sovereignty has long been considered settled. Girani-Fa III is a fortified and industrialized barren planet believed to have several underground defense complexes and a number of industrial facilities. Ducia Foundry and Imperial Armaments maintain publicly-registered mining, processing and assembly colonies on the planet under contract with the Imperial Navy.

The Gallente Federation-aligned Crux Special Tasks Group is known to carry out operations in conjunction with the Federal military and the Scope is urgently seeking comment from the Federal government.This reported assault comes at a time the Amarr Empire is on alert due to the Tanoo II bombardment incident two days ago. The means by which a dreadnought assault group could penetrate deep into Girani-Fa is unknown but the use of novel cynosural technology was observed during the Tanoo incident.

The Scope will continue to report on this developing story.
