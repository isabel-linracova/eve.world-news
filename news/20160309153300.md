X-7OMU â€“ The Sisters of EVE have launched a citizen science research program codenamed "[Project Discovery](http://www.eveonline.com/discovery/)", aimed at achieving a comprehensive categorization and analysis of tissue samples acquired from the Drifters since their emergence in early YC117.

Professor Lundberg, Chief Scientist for the SOE advanced research division, said: "It is of great importance for Project Discovery that as many capsuleers as possible take part. We believe that a proper understanding of the underlying biology of the Drifters will lead to great discoveries and advancements that will benefit all citizens of New Eden."

Citizen science is something of a novel approach for the usually secretive Sisters of EVE, however the concept has been used many times in the history of the GalNet and planetary communications networks. The SOE believe that the unique awareness and capabilities of capsuleers will be of great benefit to the effort to analyze the Drifter tissue sample database that will be used in the Project Discovery research program.
