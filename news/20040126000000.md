The two leading scientists in the Crielere program, the Gallentean Henric Touvolle and the Caldari Taromi Umailen, have publicly called for unity amongst their fellow scientists following the stunning revelations that top Caldari officials have systematically been stealing blueprints from the Crielere facilities. Many of the most prominent scientists in the program have since left their posts and gone to work for independent research firms elsewhere. Now Touvolle and Umailen, which pioneered the Crielere program in the first place, are asking the remaining scientists to stick with it despite the internal turmoil and lack of funding.  
  
 It seems unlikely that the plea from the two visionary scientists will suffice to save the Crielere program, which is on the brink of collapsing completely. Touvolle and Umailen have vowed to continue their work to the very end 'for the sake of humanity as a whole to progress to the next level', as they put it. Though their dedication and radicalism managed to build the greatest science think-tank in human history, it is difficult to see it survive without the support of the empires. Yet only time can tell.
