AMARR PRIME – Empress Catiz I has convened inaugural meetings of the Privy and Theology Councils under her reign, moving quickly to act on the vision she laid out in her public address to the Imperial Guard following her coronation last week.

Formally opening a full session of the Theology Council in Dam-Torsad's Hall of Divine Truth and Justice, Empress Catiz I asked the several thousand assembled deacons and justices of the council to carefully consider how "faith may truly be reconciled with prosperity and power in the New Era." Following her remarks the full session was adjourned and the sixty-strong Supreme Sobor of Theology began a closed door meeting.

After opening the assembly of the Theology Council, Empress Catiz returned to the Imperial Palace and convened a meeting of the Privy Council. It is understood that this first meeting was limited to the so-called "Closed Council", an exclusive gathering of Empress, Court Chamberlain and the six Royal Heirs. Matters for discussion are said to include appointments to various positions in the administration of the Amarr Empire. Not least among such offices is the post of Imperial Chancellor, left vacant by the late Lord Aritcio Kor-Azor.

The Privy Council will also hear various petitions, including the charge of blasphemy brought by the Grand Master of the Order of St. Tetrimon against the Kor-Azor Succession Trials Champion, Lysus, for his sustained public outburst during the Empress's inspection of the Imperial Guard.

In related news, Sanmatar Maleatu Shakor appeared at the Grand Caravanserai on Matar, today, apparently to report to the Tribal Council in closed session on his surprise visit to Amarr Prime to attend the coronation and festivities of that week. Although the Sanmatar's close associate, former Ambassador Keitan Yun, accompanied him during the trip, the Scope has not been able to determine his present whereabouts.

Sanmatar Shakor briefly spoke to reporters at the Grand Caravanserai, saying, “It was my pleasure to attend the coronation of the new Empress, and I must say that I found the whole affair most interesting and satisfying. As you know, the Amarr have a surprising capacity for entertaining spectacles and for my own part I greatly enjoyed the fireworks.”
