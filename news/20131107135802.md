_Yulai_ â€“ [CONCORD's](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/CONCORD) request that capsuleers assist in an assault on high-priority targets has been amended with a warning of potential retribution from enemy combatants. "We have reason to believe that our assault on this threat to [New Eden](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/New Eden (cluster)) will be met not only with open hostility, but with a cold and calculated counterblow," said Kilkkuken Mallen, CONCORD representative. "There are powers at work here that do not have the best interest of New Eden at heart, and they are gathering their forces as we speak. We fear we will have to deal with considerably greater opposition than originally expected, so we implore capsuleers yet again to side with the forces of all that is right and just - and, again, leave all the cleaning up to us."
