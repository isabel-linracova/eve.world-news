_Villore –_ The [Senate](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Senate) is in an uproar following reports a sensitive document relating to Operation Highlander, the codename of the operation to assault [Caldari Prime](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Prime), has gone missing. The document, a dossier on the planning, assessment, and post-action review, apparently contained sensitive intelligence information on other factions, including the other three empires.

The dossier had been compiled for a Senatorial oversight review of Operation Highlander, which was completed several months ago. The oversight committee included twenty senators from across Federation districts which ultimately concluded the operation was appropriately executed with contingency plans to reduce casualties and ensure success.

It is unsure how the document was lost or who it originally belonged to, but the Senate is treating the matter as a major security breach. “It is unfathomable that the dossier was allowed to be misplaced,” said Andon Gardieu, one of the district senators who participated on the oversight committee. “We will get the bottom of how this happened and if anything has fallen into the hands of foreign agents.”

The [Federal Intelligence Office](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Federal Intelligence Office) has apparently been called in to fully investigate, but has not commented on the matter.
