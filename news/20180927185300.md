Dam-Torsad, Amarr Prime â€“ Her Most Sublime and Imperial Majesty Catiz I has bestowed honors on two longstanding Amarr loyalist capsuleer organisations, the Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris and Curatores Veritatis Alliance today, as the celebrations of her second jubilee continue with the honoring of notables and responses to petitions.

Notables and petitioneers invited to personal audiences in Ittayim Palace were able to bask in the holy radiance of the Golden Throne and commune with the Empress directly. Due to ongoing security concerns, capsuleers received their honors and responses from Cardinal Sourem Itharen, Capsuleer Emissary to the Court Chamberlain, on behalf of the Holy Empress.

Under the heading of "Honors to Loyal Capsuleers of the Holy Amarr Empire", Cardinal Itharen made the following statements:

"Her Most Sublime and Imperial Majesty Catiz I, in recognition of 15 years of loyal service to Holy Amarr and four Emperors, is pleased to order that the Praetoria Imperialis Excubitoris be accorded the status of a Chapter of the Sacred Throne Order with all the rights and privileges thereof. Capsuleers of the Excubitoris Chapter may use the style of Paladin Ordinary of the Sacred Throne Order. Capsuleers of the Excubitoris Admiralty ranks, active and retired, may use the style and dignity of Paladin Commander of the Sacred Throne Order. The loyal officers of the Excubitoris may elect one of their number as Chapter Master. So ordered in the Privy Council of Her Imperial Majesty Catiz I."

"Her Most Sublime and Imperial Majesty Catiz I, in recognition of 14 years of service to Holy Amarr in the Imperial Marches of Providence, is pleased to order that the Curatores Veritatis Alliance be accorded the status of Paladin Wardens of the Providence Marches. The style of Paladin Warden of Providence may be used by capsuleers of the Curatores Veritatis. The rank of Imperial Margrave is accorded to whosoever shall hold paramount leadership of the Curatores Veritatis, presently the Margrave Equinox Daedalus of the Providence Marches. So ordered in the Privy Council of Her Imperial Majesty Catiz I."

Under the heading of "Responses to Petitions from Loyal Capsuleers of the Holy Amarr Empire", Cardinal Itharen made the following statements:

"A number of frivolous, heretical and epistemologically flawed petitions were received by the Capsuleer Emissary and these have been variously referred to the Judicial Committee of the Theology Council and the Capsuleer Monitoring Office of the Minstry of Internal Order, as appropriate."

"Several loyal and faithful capsuleer subjects sent petitions as to the trading of slaves in the markets of Holy Amarr, submitting respectfully that an Imperial Decree forbidding the trading of slaves through SCC markets in the Amarr Empire should be issued. The Privy Council of Her Imperial Majesty Catiz I declines this petition, noting that to follow its faithful, yet mistaken advice would be to infringe on the prerogatives of the Holders of Holy Amarr. So ordered in the Privy Council of Her Imperial Majesty Catiz I."

"Several loyal and faithful capsuleer subjects sent petitions as to the status of a capsuleer known as 'Nauplius', also known as 'The Butcher', and faithfully submitting that this individual is a heretic and criminal, and should be adjudged as such. This matter has been referred to the Judicial Committee of the Theology Council for investigation and consideration of remedies. So ordered in the Privy Council of Her Imperial Majesty Catiz I."

"One loyal and faithful capsuleer subject communicated in unorthodox but comprehensible fashion to the effect that they should be accorded priestly and noble rights over various Imperial territories and subjects. This petition was denied, though the Privy Council notes that the Jarldom of Sosan VII is attested in the Book of Records as a right title, though qualified under the fiefdom of Jayai as only establishing legal title and control over the northern polar square meter of Sosan VII for purposes of noble anchoring in the soil of Holy Amarr. So ordered in the Privy Council of Her Imperial Majesty Catiz I."

"Many loyal and faithful capsuleer subjects petitioned as to the status of the Imperial Marches of Providence. This petition has been disposed of with the recognition of the Curatores Veritatis Alliance as Paladin Wardens of Providence."

Cardinal Itharen closed her formal remarks by noting the pleasure with which the Holy Empress regards the loyalty and faith of Her capsuleer subjects, and that the Imperial Throne looks forward to receiving the renewal of vows of loyalty by these subjects.
