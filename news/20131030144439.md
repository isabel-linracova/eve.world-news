_New Caldari –_ The [Chief Executive Panel](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Chief Executive Panel) has released a joint statement on behalf of all CEOs of the megacorporations refuting the portion of the Operation Highlander dossier leaked by [the Scope](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The Scope) last week. “The megacorporations of the [Caldari State](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari) completely deny that any executives worked with the [Gallente Federation](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente) in bringing about the downfall of [Tibus Heth](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth) or the invasion of [Caldari Prime](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Prime),” their statement said.

Additionally, the CEP has demanded the Federation hand over a full list of compromised executives and [Navy](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Prime) officers mentioned in the report. “Infiltrating corporations in an attempt to destabilize the State also threatens the economy of the entire cluster. While our investigations have shown that the allegations are false, the fact that it was claimed implies the Federation is attempting corporate espionage. This is utterly unacceptable and all corporations throughout [New Eden](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/New Eden (cluster)) who do business are threatened by this.”

Acting [Kaalakiota](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kaalakiota Corporation) CEO [Haatakan Oiritsuu](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Haatakan Oiritsuu) made her own public statement, claiming the Federation was attempting to claim responsibility for events they had no part in. “This is typical Gallente arrogance,” she said. “Heth's downfall and removal from power was fully a result of his own insane decisions. The Federation took advantage to rid themselves of the [Titan](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Titans) over Caldari Prime, but aside from that to suggest they had widespread operatives within the megacorporations is sheer nonsense. The [Senate](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Senate) wants to pat themselves on the back for their own clever work, when in reality they had virtually nothing to do with it. They didn't assassinate Visera Yanala, they didn't attempt to confiscate corporate resources, and they didn't attempt a coup against the CEP.”
