The Imperial Throne yesterday afternoon issued a decree proclaiming that Aritcio Kor-Azor, royal heir of the Kor-Azor family, is to be awarded the post of Imperial Chancellor. The post, one of the most coveted and influential positions within the Empire, has, according to the decree, traditionally been awarded “only to those servants of Amarr who have distinguished themselves as faithful to our holy empire and its interests above all other things.”

As Chancellor, Lord Kor-Azor will sit at the head of a political machine whose influence reaches across several hundred governmental institutions into every corner of the Empire’s day-to-day function. He will oversee the largest single work force in the Amarr Empire and the next-largest in New Eden, second only to the Gallente Federation’s Quafe Corporation.

The empress’s announcement comes as little surprise to the people of Kor-Azor’s domain, who have been enjoying the reforms of their ruler ever since his punishment early last year at the hands of one of the Speakers of Truth, a theological order sanctioned by the Throne to enforce religious law.

In the time since then, Lord Kor-Azor has initiated a number of programs explicitly and transparently designed to benefit the lower social tiers of his populace, moves which more often than not required elaborate diplomatic action toward the Holders of his domain. His conduct in these matters has been celebrated by both political operatives and laymen as shrewd and moral in equal measure.

The office of House Kor-Azor released a statement on the heir’s behalf this morning, claiming he is “ecstatic to be presented with this tremendous opportunity to serve his Empress, his God and the glorious nation of Amarr.” Kor-Azor is expected to assume his new post within the next few days.
