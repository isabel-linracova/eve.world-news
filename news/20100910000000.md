PATOR - Protestors upset with the planned staging of controversial 6-centuries-old play ‘Plantation’ picketed the box office of the Minmatar People's Theatre today. As the office opened and season passes went on sale, protestors carried signs and chanted slogans portraying the MPT as slave-holders.&nbsp;

"This is ridiculous" said the show's director, Jaken Lagos. "I'm receiving death threats over this. The setting is updated to modern day Pator, and all the characters are now Minmatar, so how it can be racist?"

"People should see the play before they judge,” he added.

Equality in Action has claimed no knowledge of death threats but vowed to continue pressuring the MPT to cancel the production.
