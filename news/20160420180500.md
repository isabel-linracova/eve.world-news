Dam-Torsad, Amarr Prime â€“ The remaining two Royal Heirs in contention for the Golden Throne of Amarr, Lord Aritcio Kor-Azor and Lady Catiz Tash-Murkon, met with their respective Champions and teams of capsuleer retainers today. The two teams will fight to determine the next ruler of Holy Amarr in the Finals of the YC118 Amarr Championships beginning at 17:00 New Eden Time this Friday, 22nd April.

The Kor-Azor team is led by House Champion Lysus and made up of his retainers, Anariasis, Hoodie Mafia and Sarek Minyatar. The House Stages run of the Lysus team was filled with ups and downs but triumph in the play-offs between the final House Champion teams sent Lord Lysus and his retainers to the finals.

The Tash-Murkon team is led by House Champion Kelon Darklight and made up of his retainers, Lucian IV, Maxine Antilles and Wasa Qc. The House Stages path taken by the Kelon Darklight team was marked by their undefeated run right through to the victory that sent them to the finals of the trials.

His Royal Highness Aritcio Kor-Azor has become the default favorite of traditionalists and those who wish to consolidate the Amarr Empire and take a conservative approach to interstellar relations. His role as Imperial Chancellor under the rule of Her Majesty Jamyl I was marked by unswerving loyalty to the Throne, with a tendency of shifting the balance of politics to the favor of the central authorities at the expense of Holders and local rulers.

Her Royal Highness Catiz Tash-Murkon is more favored by progressives and outward-looking elements in the power structure of the Amarr Empire, with her emphasis on the importance of trade and diplomacy particularly appreciated by nobility with extensive business interests and the Holders of outlying territories. The military and the religious colleges have kept aloof from the matter of the Imperial Succession, as is proper during the interregnum period, but there is some suggestion of disquiet at the prospect of a Tash-Murkon Empress in the most conservative circles of those two centers of authority in the Empire.

The numerous capsuleers that are attending the event have been travelling to Amarr Prime all this week. Parties of the elite pilots arriving planetside are being welcomed to the structures requisitioned by the Order of St. Tetrimon to serve as the Capsuleer Enclave in Dam-Torsad. All of Holy Amarr awaits the outcome of the final trials this coming Friday, and every lodging place in the Imperial City of Dam-Torsad and its outlying suburbs is filled to capacity by the multitudes eager to witness this historic occasion.
