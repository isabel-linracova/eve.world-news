AMARR – Residents of downtown Dam-Torsad were greeted with an extraordinary sight this afternoon, as senior officers of the Imperial Guard, including Commanding Officer General Momed Sarshor, toured a number of routes through the Empire’s capital city as part of security preparations for the coronation of Empress Catiz I.

Excited citizens took to the fluid routers throughout the early afternoon, posting pictures and holovids of more than fifty officers dressed in specially commissioned golden ceremonial dropsuits bearing the sigil of the Emperor Family.

In some instances, the Imperial Guard took time out from what is believed to be an inspection tour in order to pose for pictures with bystanders and observers. The Scope was able to secure several minutes of General Sarshor’s time to find out more about preparations for the coronation of Empress Catiz I, which will be held on September 27th.

Speaking when questioned regarding the presence of the Imperial Guard, the General confirmed that “while the exact details of this operation are classified, part of today’s objective is a basic field test of new dropsuit technology that has recently been developed.”

He continued to expand on preparations for the coronation ceremony, and concerns which have been raised regarding security, commenting that that “there are some who would like to prevent the rightful ascension of the Empress to the throne, based on ridiculous notions of inappropriate lineage and impurity. The Imperial Guard is here to ensure that any such heretical behavior and rumors are quashed with extreme prejudice.”

The Imperial Armed Forces remain on high alert since the assassination of Empress Jamyl I a little over a year ago, with a security budget rumored to be in the hundreds of billions assigned to the coronation ceremony, which is due to take place later this month.
