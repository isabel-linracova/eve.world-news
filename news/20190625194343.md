The Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx provides your roundup of the latest news from around New Eden as the Triglavian Collective brings its invasion to a new climax with the appearance of "World Arks" and new messages from the enigmatic Zorya Triglav.

**Terror from the Abyss as Triglavian World Arks Invade Multiple Star Systems**

Yulai, Genesis – Despite continued reassurances from CONCORD that the Triglavian invasion is "contained", the last week has seen repeated incursions of the vast "World Ark" vessels into multiple star systems across New Eden's core regions. The best efforts of [capsuleer forces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2N2Qrk0ZX8) appear to be the only serious opposition to the Triglavian threat, although CONCORD and its DED forces have made claims that they are regularly disrupting the formation of conduits from Abyssal Deadspace into the heart of our star cluster.

The Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx has consulted with a number of eminent scientists and technical specialists from centers of learning and reputable corporations across New Eden. The result of this survey of expert knowledge is a clear consensus that the Triglavian Collective has, in fact, achieved a primary first goal in its invasion efforts by establishing a subtle but important alteration to the fabric of space-time in the core systems of the cluster. The result, in the words of Dr. Santina Ygrai of Duvolle Laboratories, is "a form of lasting resonance or attunement of the local space-time of the core regions of New Eden with the, so to speak, fabric of Abyssal Deadspace's deep folds and whorls of space-time."

As extraordinary and incomprehensible as this claim may be, there appears to be a swelling consensus in the scientific and technical community that theTriglavians have at the very least determined the most expeditious and efficient means of transporting the enormous mass of their World Ark vessels from the Abyss into New Eden. The long-term consequences of this development are highly uncertain but clearly hold the potential for widespread destruction and tragedy across New Eden's civilization.

**Zorya Triglav Sends New Message Through Triglavian Devices; Capsuleer Theories Increasingly Accepted**

Yulai, Genesis – As the Triglavian offensive unceasingly ramps up, capsuleers have been continuing to receive or intercept messages of Triglavian origin on the communications devices known as "Semiosis Conduction Consoles", sharing the basic data and their various conclusions with the GalNet-viewing public. The Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx understands that CONCORD, government agencies, national corporations and many other organizations have also been listening in on Triglavian communications but notes that none of these parties have been forthcoming with the information that public-spirited capsuleers have [provided to all](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/arc-semiosis/147507).

The latest series of communications from the Triglavians have included a message that is apparently an operational update pertaining to the appearance of the "World Arks", a partial schematic of uncertain design, and an enigmatic but highly menacing message apparently delivered by the entity calling itself "Zorya Triglav". Capsuleer analysts of these messages, and the many that have gone before, are increasingly finding their theories accepted as plausible in the mainstream academic, political and security communities of New Eden's core empires. Despite this, there are numerous competing and strongly-held interpretations among both capsuleer and non-capsuleer analysts.

**Attempted Triglavian Raids on Planets "Repelled by Enhanced Orbital, Atmospheric and Surface Defenses"**

Yulai, Genesis – In perhaps the most disturbing development of the invasion yet, Triglavian vessels have attempted to raid a number of planets, confirmed Provost Marshal Kasiha Valkanir of AEGIS, in an interview with the Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx. The head of CONCORD's AEGIS division declined to specify the planets involved, "as that is a matter for the relevant local authorities." However, the former SARO field agent was able to reveal that a number of core empire planets had been raided by Triglavian forces, sometimes supported by subverted rogue drones, but that these assaults had been "comprehensively repelled by enhanced orbital, atmospheric and surface defenses."

For the duration of the Triglavian invasion crisis, the CONCORD agency headed by Provost Marshal Valkanir has been given a co-ordinating role in the over-arching campaign of defense against Triglavian attacks on static targets such as space installations, asteroid colonies, moon settlements and, most vitally, planetary bodies. While the core empires and their respective regional governments are directly responsible for defense of systems and their celestial bodies, AEGIS is supplying vital logistical support, detachments of specialist troops and equipment, and early-warning and intelligence of Triglavian movements.

**Khumatar Allek Berialsh Inspects Matar Orbital Defenses; No Comment on Tronhadar Free Guard Deployments**

Pator, Heimatar – Matar's newly-drafted Planetary Security Co-ordinator, Khumatar Allek Berialsh has completed a preliminary inspection of the planet's orbital defense network amidst an atmosphere of increasing controversy over the circumstances of the recent attack on the coastal zone of the Mikramurka region by Blood Raiders.

In particular, questions have been [raised](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/request-for-clarification-of-rumours-concerning-the-krusual-tribe/165491) over the Krusual Tribe's re-activation of their mountain fortresses and underground bunkers shortly before the attack took place, though these have been angrily rejected by the Krusual as "insulting conspiracy theories." Despite the Krusual Tribe's dismissal of those questions, the news that units of the Tronhadar Free Guard were deployed for cold-weather warfare training in an undisclosed area of Mikramurka tundra has breathed new life into the brewing tribal dispute.

Mikramurka clans and the locally-dominant Sebiestor Tribe have also expressed some disquiet at the swift appointment of Khumatar Berialsh, despite his connections to the Sebiestor and the late Chief Karin Midular. Though none will admit it publicly, the fact that Berialsh chose to leave the Sebiestor and join the returned Starkmanir Tribe under tribal adoption provisions has caused a number of clan elders in the Mikramurka region to express private dismay that he should be appointed in the aftermath of their local tragedy.

**Onikanabo Brigade Justifies Intaki V Operations Using Corporate Reparations Provisions in Caldari CEMWPA Zone**

Intaki, Placid – The Onikanabo Brigade has issued a formal notice that its mercenary operations on Intaki V are in pursuit of "corporate reparations" in breaking and extraordinary news from the Intaki system. The home system of the Intaki culture is currently within the Caldari-controlled portion of the disputed zone between the Caldate State and Gallente Federation specified by the CONCORD Emergency Militia War Powers Act. The Caldari PMC asserts that it is operating on behalf of a client with "well-founded claims to recover reparations from properties and resources linked to certain radical sects of the Ida movement." Reports from Intaki V claim that the Brigade has "sacked a dozen Ida monasteries and burned down a score of attached villages and communal plantations."

The status of Intaki V has regularly been a matter of some uncertainty as control of the Placid region, and Intaki system in particular, has shifted over the long years of the Caldari-Gallente militia conflict. A long-standing, tacit agreement between the Caldari State and Gallente Federation has generally allowed for the Intaki Assembly to maintain its sovereignty and control of Intaki V even during periods where Caldari militia forces have controlled the system itself. The Caldari State's Chief Executive Panel, representing the balance of consensus among the "Big 8" Caldari megacorps, has been content to leave the arrangement undisturbed since the fall of Tibus Heth's Provist regime in YC115. The role of Mordu's Legion in maintaining this situation has undoubtedly been key, as an organization trusted in both the Caldari State and broad sections of Intaki society.

However, the Scope's Galactic Hour with Ret Gloriaxx understands that Caldari corporate law allows a significant degree of latitude in which the more independent corporations can in principle operate when the system is under State control as part of a war zone. Despite this, it is thought unlikely that even such an organization as the Onikanabo Brigade would take the step of forcibly seizing properties and resources on Intaki V without the backing of at least one megacorporation. For its part, the Ishukone megacorporation, which has long maintained a major interest and investment in the system, has signalled its intention to challenge the Onikanabo Brigade's use of corporate reparations provisions as justification for seizures and related operations on Intaki V.
