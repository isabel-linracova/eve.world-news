VILLORE – President Jacus Roden has been sworn in for a second term of office during an inauguration ceremony held at Senate Headquarters, in orbit of the sixth moon of Villore Seven.

Lead by Head Senator Andon Gardieu and observed by the entire Senate, along with Broyal Alserette, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, President Roden re-affirmed his commitment to the office of President with the traditional Oath of Affirmation which was broadcast to an estimated 9 trillion across the Federation.

Flanked by Mentas Blaque, Director of the Black Eagles and Gilles Ranchel, head of the Senate Domestic Security Council, President Roden repeated Senator Gardieu’s words with his right hand placed on the Senate’s leather bound copy of the Federal Constitution to complete the ceremony, as she read the Oath of Affirmation to him:

“I, Jacus Roden, do solemnly swear before the Federal Senate and Federal Supreme Court, that I will faithfully and honorably execute the office of President of the Federated Union of Gallente Prime, and will, to the best of my ability, ensure that my actions in office protect, preserve and defend the values and principles of the people, as laid out in the Constitution of the Federated Union of Gallente Prime.”

Immediately after the ceremony, President Roden spoke with press to offer his thanks to the Gallente people for their support, before being quizzed on his administration’s security policies following the appearance of unidentified vessels and structures within Federal borders, confirming that “the Federal Intelligence Office and Federation Navy are in the midst of a joint investigation, with information from Tripwire Command. Until we have further data, the Federation Navy will remain in a state of high alert.”
