_Perimeter_ - The Caldari Navy has distributed the bounties to the capsuleers who participated in the slaying of the renegade 37th ‘Octopus’ Squadron members who stole over a dozen capital ships from a naval shipyard in Otsasi. In total, 685 Pilot License Extensions (PLEX) were handed out of a pool of 700 available bounties.

Two bounties were unpaid, because the corpses of ringleader Kossen Jaikka and lieutenant Verkkomi Obanin were undelivered. Despite this, the Navy is confident the two were slain. “CONCORD records show that their capsules were destroyed and the two did not have known clone contracts,” said Wing Commander Hikemi Korrado. “Regardless, this operation has been a complete success. The entirety of the stolen capital ships have been destroyed and the leaders of the rogue squadron have been executed. We thank capsuleers for their assistance in the matter and have rewarded them appropriately.”

On the case of Pandemic Legion, which aided and abetted the Provists several times, Korrado said the Navy is still weighing its options. “Such dissent from capsuleers will not be tolerated,” she said. “However, we are still discussing how to best handle the situation with CONCORD. Having them declared pirates within Caldari space is not outside the realm of possibility.”

The Navy has released a list of all bounty claimants. It is as follows:
