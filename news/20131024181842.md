_Orvolle –_ [The Scope](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The Scope) has obtained and released a portion of the [Senate](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Senate) report on Operation Highlander. According to the dossier, the [Federation](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente) has had operatives infiltrating the [Caldari State](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari) since the outbreak of the Empyrean War in YC110. This includes numerous operatives engaged in long-term, deep-cover operations within all eight Caldari megacorporations.

The released information claims several high-level megacorp executives had been compromised by intelligence operatives, contributing to the destabilization of the [Heth](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth) regime prior to the attack on [Caldari Prime](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Prime). The names of the executives are absent from the document, but it claims none are still considered active assets for the Federation following the downfall of Heth. It does refer to several “less valuable assets” that remain within the megacorps, [Caldari Navy](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Navy), and [State Protectorate](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/State Protectorate).

Citing whistleblower and freedom of information laws in its decision to release the information, the Scope has claimed the release of the document is legal. Despite this, [Black Eagles](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Black Eagles) operatives were seen raiding several of the Scope’s offices throughout the Federation.
