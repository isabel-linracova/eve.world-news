Harsh words have been exchanged between the Kador family and the Tash-Murkon family regarding the latter's plans to turn a religious site into a tourist attraction. Catiz Tash-Murkon recently bought the now infamous cathedral on Eclipticum, the site of the sordid incident involving Articio Kor-Azor. The cathedral has been closed since the incident and in need of repairs and renovations. None has been willing to take up this burden until Catiz stepped in.  
  
Catiz plans to fund the extensive repairs needed by allowing tourists, for the first time, to visit the holy site - dedicated to the saint Tal-Romon, the first Udorian to reach sainthood.  
  
This has sparked a hot debate amongst the Amarrians, and been especially fiercely criticized by the Kador and Ardishapur families, which are outraged that commoners will be allowed to walk the hallow grounds around the esteemed cathedral. But Catiz is adamant she will continue with the plan 'in honor of St. Tal-Romon, which was a guiding light in his time and should continue to be so in our time.'
