Yulai - Caldari mega-corporation shares across the State have begun to freefall following word that Home Guard troops have been deployed to the Constructions Armor Forge facility on Piak III. This follows a spate of bad news for the State in recent weeks as investors continue to sell off Caldari assets and move to more secure investments, in particular Federation securities. Leading analysts are calling the situation at Piak "emblematic of the State's broader issues", citing the rampant inflation figures for the localized economies under mega-corporation control. Shares of Caldari Constructions stock, leading the downward spiral of the broader Caldari Funds Index, have already lost more than 30 percent of their value in heavy trading.
