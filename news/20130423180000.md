_Amarr â€“_ [Empress](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr Emperor) [Jamyl I](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jamyl I) has made an increasing number of contradictory and otherwise irrational statements and decisions over the past several months, according to several independent political commentators familiar with the Imperial Court.

The commentators point to several specific incidents highlighting her inconsistency. The first is her vacillation on the [Ardishapur Family](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ardishapur Family) educational reforms, which regularly changed from week to week from full support to outright anger. The empress was originally displeased with [Ardishapur](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Yonis Ardishapur) acting without her consent, then apparently approving of his initiative and the results of the reforms.

Most recently was her vigorous approval of the extreme celebrations taking place in the Kador realms. Despite the rather stoic customs of the [Amarr](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr)often urging restraint, the empress encouraged open revelry to the point where numerous individuals were injured. Coinciding with this, the empress forced the[Kador Family](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kador Family) to shuffle around and constantly replace security forces, resulting in a [Blood Raider](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Blood Raider) attack on an ill-defended religious site in [the Bleak Lands](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The Bleak Lands) while locations in high security space were left over-garrisoned.

Additionally, the empress has been notably silent on several matters, such as the political strife inside the [Caldari State](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari). While she had previously not hesitated to offer support to the Empire's allies, she has recently shown a cold shoulder even while the Caldari and Amarr militias struggled to maintain their positions.

These public reports have also been coupled with troubling rumors from the Imperial Court. The empress has apparently become prone to falling into sudden bouts of silence or being taken with anger at minor slights. Some claim she has been seen talking to herself, on one occasion engaged in what appeared to be a rather vehement argument.

Finally, Jamyl I's open proclamation encouraging the first generation of clone soldiers to the Empire, in the face of the other nations of [New Eden](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/New Eden (cluster)) rejecting them, has been questioned. Ever since this declaration, the Empire has been tight-lipped about the clone soldiers and has refused to comment on the effectiveness of the program.

Commentators have been unwilling to speculate on the cause of the empress's seeming instability. The [Emperor Family](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Emperor Family) has refused comment.
