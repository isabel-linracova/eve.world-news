Today marks the first of three days of group stages as teams fight it out for a spot in the finals next Sunday.

Teams have been scrambling to find the winning combination of ship and tactics to make it to the end. Interstellar Correspondents' tournament site contains a wealth of data and information that may just make that happen. In addition to current data, information from several past tournaments can also be pulled up for study.

## [IC's AT VIII Coverage](http://at.eve-ic.net/8/)

## [IC's AT VII Coverage](http://at.eve-ic.net/7/)

It is of particular note that as this writing, no team fielding less than 12 ships has won their match, regardless of fleet composition and tactics.

Good luck to all the teams and keep hitting that refresh button on our site!
