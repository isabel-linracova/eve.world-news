_New Caldari â€“_ [Tibus Heth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus Heth) was absent from a board meeting of the [Chief Executive Panel](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Chief Executive Panel) scheduled today to discuss the findings of the investigation into the events surrounding the Battle for [Caldari Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Prime). [Kaalakiota](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kaalakiota Corporation) instead sent CFO Amaari Siainki in his place.

The move is considered highly unusual for the embattled State Executor, who normally insists upon CEO attendance at all board meetings of the CEP. Kaalakiota has not released any statements discussing Heth's decision to miss the meeting. Rumors, however, state that the KK CEO has not been seen since his disastrous public appearance on Monday, when his attempts at explaining his involvement in Admiral Yanala's death were met with hostility and an eventual riot.

The numerous riots that broke out following the revelation that Admiral Yanala had been forced into the [Tea Maker Ceremony](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tea Maker Ceremony) have mostly calmed. However, numerous protests are ongoing. The [Provist](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari Providence Directorate) forces, who had been ubiquitous at the protests and have been blamed for inciting many of the protestors to riot, have notably been absent over the past 24 hours. At the same time, there are indications that many members of Heth's inner circle have also suddenly vanished.

The Provists have, similar to Kaalakiota, remained silent on the sudden change.
